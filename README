 you will see a whole lot of files checked out for example:

A    trunk/debian/changelog                                                                                                                                              
A    trunk/debian/copyright                                                                                                                                              
A    trunk/debian/easygp-client.install                                                                                                                                  
A    trunk/debian/make-server.sh        

Checked out revision xyz.

2) Compile the help files, these can only be run from within EasyGP at
   the current time.
   
 user ~ easygp  $  $  cd trunk/help/
 user ~ easygp/trunk/help  $  ruby basicdoc.rb easygp.bd
 user ~ easygp/trunk/help  $
 
 3) Build the EasyGP database which will also import lookup data
 
   user ~ easygp $  cd ../db (change back to trunk)
   user ~ easygp/db $ ./install-easygp.sh
   
   If errors occur they will be found in the file /tmp/easygp-errors and you should mail the developers for help
   
 4) Run Gambas3 and selected your project and from within the IDE make sure that the startup file is
    Sources/startup/modStartup (the default), run the project and follow the install wizard to add your organisation/users.
