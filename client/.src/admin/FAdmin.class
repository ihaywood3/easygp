' PURPOSE         The main admin module which as the name suggests is
'                 for administrative functions
'                 FGlobalPreferences = pathways etc, global to program
'                 FImportLegacyData = import legacy data - not functioning
'                 FRoomSetup = setup for room peculiar settings eg printers
'                 FAdminRequests = set up who we send requests to, maintain request names
'                 FImportPostcodes = An (Austrlian at the moment) postcode import wizard
'                 FHL7Management = set up providers sending us HL7 or scanned docs
'                 FIXME this is then a misnomer
'                 FAdminVaccinations = set up vaccination schedules, add vaccine names
'HOW THIS WORKS   User clicks on the 'Admin' button on the main button bar
'                 FMain.btnSection_Admin_Click(), which instantiates this form and
'                 calls (Init) where only FGlobalPreferences is instantiated. All other
'                 forms are loaded when a particular tab is clicked on.
'SAVING SETTINGS  As this and its child forms are never 'closed' here, when the program
'                 finally quites, FMain.Settings_Save will save any settings changes
'                 There are no settings on this form to load.
'BUGS             Please report to rterry@pacific.net.au
