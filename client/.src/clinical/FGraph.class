' PURPOSE  : quickndirty graphing utility
' USED BY  : FClinical and Finbox and FStaffTasks
' HOW WORKS: current consult gives us access to patients measurements
'            if loinc code and graphable will be graphed
' TODO     : EVERYTHING, Including, after a little thought, using
'            this in FClinical
