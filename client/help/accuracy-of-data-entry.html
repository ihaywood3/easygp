<h2>Accuracy of Data Entry</h2>
<p/>
There is an old saying which is very applicable to medical records:
<p/>
<i>Garbage in garbage out.</i> <p/>
Like most things in life a good longterm positive outcome depends on the effort you put in to the foundations, and medical 
records are no different. Taking the time to learn to accurately code your diagnoses, and accurately record the patients 
problems will pay off in the long run.
<p/>
Even when problem lists exist in records, users (mostly doctors, and latterly nurses) tend to date problems not from their 
true date of historical onset, but from the day the user enters the data. Irrelevant diagnoses such as 'tonsillitis' share 
common standing with diabetes. 
<p/>
Worse, many medical programs, thinking they are being very clever,  add problems to 
the 'problem list', as the user enters the details for why a prescription may be written - but their 'enforcing' of 
reason for prescription leads to multiple errors as often wrong or inaccurate diagnoses are picked.
<p/>
The enforcing of a 'coded diagnosis' as the problem - means that more and more, many patients clinical records look the same.
<p/>
In the final analysis, at best, most practices end up with a pretty tatty list of problems or diagnoses which 
bear little resemblance to what is actually going on with the patient. One patients 'Diabetes Type 2' could represent a
well controlled diabetes with no target organ damage and a HBA1c of 5.9, with the same diagnosis in the next patient meaning 
poorly controlled diabetic with hba1c of 8.5 and multiple signs of end organ damage.
<p/>
With creation of care plans relegated to the  
use of templates, this disorganisation is further propegated, and the resultant document, meant to be the over-riding 
guide to the patients health care management becomes a jumbled disorganised mess which bears little resemblance to reality.
