<h2>Add Contact Method</h2>
<p/>
We use the term 'contact method' or 'communication' in the broadest sense. Gone are the days when a persons 'home phone' was a fixed land line. 
This century it is more likely to be a mobile phone, VOIP etc, rather than a fixed line. Hence a 'communication' is any method 
of contacting a person.

</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> If this cannot happen automatically e.g it is a home phone, then it is important you set the type accurately, and clicking the type combo-box will give you a complete list of options.
