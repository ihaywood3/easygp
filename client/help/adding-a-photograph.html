<h2>Adding a Photograph</h2>
<p/>
<p/>
In many sections of EasyGP including the contacts modules for patients and staff, it is possible add a photo to 
the database. The screen images  here are the same for both these sections named above.
<p/>
By default no image exists and a placeholder will always be shown.
<p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="contacts/patients/patients_new_photo_empty.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>
</ul>
<p/>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li><b>Aquire  </b> This feature is not yet implemented

</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li><b>Remove</b> If you have previously loaded a patient's photo and wish to remove it the photo picturebox will be reset.
</ul></td></tr></table><p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="contacts/patients/patients_new_photo_loaded.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li><b>Load  </b> Clicking this will present you with a file dialog to load an existing photograph

</ul>
</td></tr></table><p/>
Note as with all information within an editing area, it will not be saved until the Save Button (F12) is clicked in the relevant section.
