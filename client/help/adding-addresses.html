<h2>Adding Addresses</h2>
<p/>
The EasyGP database structure allows a 'one to many' relationship between Organisations, persons and addresses. Translated into 
plain english this means that a person can have none, one, or many addresses, and the same for Organisations, however the way 
this is handled differs between persons and organisations. 
<p/>
<b>Adding an Address to an Organisation.</b> <p/>
The mechanics of this are identical to adding addresses for a person except for one factor. As an organisation has one or many 
branches technically each branch only has a single address so there is no 'list' of addresses for organisations within the edit area.
<p/>
<b>Content of the Address Fields</b> <p/>
As the term 'address' is used in a loose way it could be:

<ul>
<li> An actual street complete with suburb<li> A street with no suburb<li> A suburb with no street<li> The location of a  department e.g 3rd Floor Block D, with no other information if it is a branch address<li> Can be the 'default address' or a 'postal address'.
</ul>
<b>Adding Addresses to Patients or other People</b> <p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="contacts/general/address_new_enter_data.png" /></td><td><p/>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> As described in the section on adding phone numbers, just enter the street and suburb details or whatever minimum amount of
information is required. Note that in some sections you will be prompted at the time you save the record if anything is missing.

</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>Australian suburbs and postcodes are supplied with EasyGP and will appear automatically as you type. A valid town must be 
selected and free text is not allowed.
</ul></td></tr></table><p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="contacts/general/address_types.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>Whilst most addresses in the patients section will be home addresses (the default), you have the option of a number of others
 by clicking the drop down combobox.

</ul>
</td></tr></table><p/>
Once happy with the data, click the 'Add' button and the address will appear on the list below the address data entry area. 
Remember that this data is not saved to the database until the Save button is clicked (or F12 key pressed).
<p/>
<b>Editing or Deleting an Existing Address</b> <p/>
Clicking the right mouse button will give you the options of editing (to allow change) or deleting an existing address.
