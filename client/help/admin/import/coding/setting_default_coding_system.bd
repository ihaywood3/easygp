.subsubsection Coding - Set Default

In the current version of EasyGP there may only be one coding system in use. Once selected this may not be 
changed unless you have not yet entered any clinical records, so it should be one of the first tasks you do. 
Hopefully in a later version of the program it will be possible to convert from one coding system 
to another but this is not guaranteed.
