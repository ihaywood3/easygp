.subsubsection Importing Data From Other Systems
 

The exent to which this is possible varies between medical record programs. One of the problems with legacy medical record systems
is that the database structure is not properly normalised, so that it may not be possible to import as much as you would like, however 
easygp will make every attempt to pull in as much data as possible.

The specifications for the file import structure may be obtained from the developers, however it is anticipated that in future 
standard export formats from programs such as Medical Director or Best Practice will be supported.
