.subsubsection Global Request Ordering

Before you can print request forms, the adminstrator will need to tell EasyGP, the names of the companies 
that are used to  send requests to, for example though a company's name may be obvious to the user eg OurTown Radiology, 
the companies actual database key (a number) must be linked to the type of request - here to radiology or imaging.  

The choices the adminstrator makes on this screen are the defaults for all users, but are over-ridden by the users 
personal choices of who they use as their initial default provider, which they will set in the Preferences section of the program. When 
the user selects anyone other than their default provider, the global default branch for that provider will be used.

Any of the request categories available in the list on the left hand side of this screen, should you have needs in addition to that, please contact the developers.

The Companies, employees or persons to whom you send requests must exist in the contacts database, you cannot enter the actual details 
on this screen, but via the contacts section accessable on the main button bar on the far left of this screen.

Once you have entered the details in contacts do the following:

.item click the 'Request Type' list on the left side of the screen
.item click on the add new button in the editing area
.item using the option buttons, decide if the entity is a company, employee, or a person which will set the type of search
.item type in the search text box and make 
you selection from the popup lists.
.item if sending to a company, select a branch - this will default to head office but can be changed
.item once happy with your selections click the save button

.bold Selecting a default branch

Once you have selected a provider, you may should select a default branch, which will appear on the top of request forms, which
will help patients attending the collection centre or provider of the service you are ordering. Click the 'Default Branch' combo 
box to make your selection. 

.bold Modifying or Deleting an Existing Company

Click on the company name in the list with the right mouse button will popup a menu.

In Addition, each individual staff member may select their prefered Company and branch for any of these request types 
in the Staff Section - Doctors Preferences - Default Providers for Requests tab.
