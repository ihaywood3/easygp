.subsubsection Maintaining Requests
EasyGP comes with a huge range of existing names for requests or services, to assist you in your ordering and these are subdivided into 
types of requests:

Radiology
Physiotherapy
Cardiovascular
Vascular
Neurology
Obstetric
Respiratory
Podiatry
Audiology
Nuclear Medicine
ophthalmology
gastroenterology
Exercise Physiology

Should this list be inadequate and you would like another category you should try and put a very strong case forward to the EasyGP developers, but to be successful
 you would have to be
.bold very
pursuasive!

.bold Adding New Requests

There is however no limit to the additional number of requests you can add, you are allowed to mess up your database as much as you want - be it on your head. 
Personally I'd be very careful and only add new request names which are essential.

.item First you should check you just havn't overlooked an identical existing term. Click on the category of request, then type into the search textbox 
located at the bottom of the list of existing requests for that category
.item Click on the button labelled 'New Request'
.item From the combo box, select the category type
.item Type in the term.

Hint: long terms can be difficult to find in search lists, for example:

Cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies

To make terms easier to find, adding an abbreviation to the term can make your searching much easier:

Cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (CCP)

.item Decide if the term needs to be lateralised, i.e left or right or both, eg boney fractures often are lateralised.
.item Click the save button

Remember that once you have created the new term, once it has been used internally in EasyGP it may never be removed.

.bold Editing an Existing Request

Hightlight the term or request in the requests list, right mouse click, select the edit menu, make your changes and then save the term.
