.subsubsection Room Setup

This will tell EasyGP where how you wish to set up your clinic rooms.

.bold  Default Printer

     This should be the printer in your room you wish to use to print plain paper documents. 
     
     
     Within EasyGP you can over-ride this at any time to print to any printer on the network.
     
     
.bold Script Printer

     In many clinic rooms, the staff member will have to print to pre-formatted script paper.
     Please test your printers to ensure they are working satisfactorily before saving these defaults.
