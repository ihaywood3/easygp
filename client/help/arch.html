<p/>
No package currently exists for the development version of Gambas 3.0 in Arch so you will need to build this from the gambas3 svn. 
<p/>
Either download the EasyGP source code tree by typing this at a terminal: 
svn checkout svn://ozdocit.org/easygp/trunk
<p/>
or download only the necessary files described below from the source code tree at http://ozdocit.org/easygp/trunk/arch directory. 
<p/>
Once these files are obtained you will need to:
<p/>

<ul>
<li> Create a build directory<li> Copy the gambas3 files into that build directory<li> Change the name of PKGBUILD.gambas3 to PKGBUILD<li> Build the package by typing makepkg (or makepkg --asroot)<li> Install the package the usual way using pacman e.g pacman -U gambas3-svn-pkgnumber.tar.gz
</ul>

<p/>
Once gambas3 has been built, you may run this, locate your downloaded EasyGP svn and run this as a project, or if you've not yet downloaded 
the easygp svn, you can create an svn project from within gambas itself.
