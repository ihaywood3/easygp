<h2>Auditing</h2>
<p/>
Every time data is written to the database in EasyGP it is in some way audited, though most this occurs 'under the hood', and will not be 
intrusive to the user.
<p/>
Where information is being changed from that which currently exists in the database - either when a record is being in some way changed or 
deleted, then the auditing will enforce the rule that the user enter a reason for why this is occuring 
<b>unless explicitly stated otherwise. </b> For example a popup menu may have an option to undertake an action such as "Mark complete with no explanation", in which case, the user, 
by accepting this option, is taking responsiblity for this action.
<p/>
For example in the scratchpad section, when you delete an item, ie it was not actioned as completed in some way, but is being removed, 
then you will have to complete this dialog:
<p/>
<p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/scratchpad_audit_delete.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> The following information will always be supplied:
</ul>

<ul>
<li> The current user who is undertaking the action - yourself<li> The patient's name<li> The type of action eg Deletion<li> The data being changed or deleted
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> The Reason for the action must then be supplied by the user, or the action cancelled.
</ul>
</td></tr></table><p/>
