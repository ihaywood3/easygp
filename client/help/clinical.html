<h2>Clinical</h2>
<p/>
All data related to patient care is entered here. Before you can enter clinical data, there are several things which must be performed or configured.
<p/>
<b>Staff Members must be entered in the database</b> <p/>
Any of the staff in the practice  who will be using EasyGP for clinical or clerical purposes must have been entered in the contacts 
database. This is accessed from the main sidebar by clicking the staff members button. An appropriate access level for clinical data 
must be allocated (see 
<a href="practice-staff.html">Practice Staff</a>)
<p/>
<b>Lookup Data needs to be imported</b> <p/>
EasyGP needs data to function and at a minumum this will need to be some source of
<p/>

<ul>
<li> Patient Demographic Data  must be be entered by hand, or imported  en-mass (see <a href="patients.html">Patients</a>). There is a single patient for you to play with 'Mr Test Patient' already present in the database
<li> Coding system data  must be selected and imported (see <a href="importing-coding-data.html">Importing Coding Data</a>)
<li> Drug Data must be selected and imported (see <a href="importing-drug-data.html">Importing Drug Data</a>)

</ul>
<b>Providers need to be added</b> <p/>
 Providers are persons or companies providing services to your practice -e.g pathology providers, cardiologists, physiotherapists, psychologists.
Whereas EasyGP will function for clinical notes without these, it will be severely limited (see 
<a href="contacts-manager.html">Contacts Manager</a>and 
<a href="allocating-categories.html">Allocating Categories</a>)
<p/>
<b>HL7 Downloading needs to be configured.</b> <p/>
This is explained in detail in documents section (see
<a href="inbox.html">Inbox</a>)
<p/>
<b>A Configuration file needs to be present</b> <p/>
Without this tiny little file, the GUI is going to be a real mess - called easygp.conf, it should have be installed when you first 
loaded EasyGP and it is usually found in your /home/user/.config/easygp directory.
<p/>
Finally, reading this help file from top to bottom would be of great assistance.
