.subsection Medical Certificates

Any certificates written  are recorded in the patients progress notes and the resultant certificates 
are accessible at all times in the main clinical section on the tabbed lists on the right hand side of the screen, where they may be actioned as desired, for 
example you may wish to re-print a certificate.

If you take a look at the image of a certificate to the left, the procedure is fairly self explanatory. Where multiple selection of text 
exists, such as selecting a coded reason, you will be presented with popup lists.

.bold Reason for the certificate 
can be in plain text

.bold The Coded Term 
must be selected from your coding system

.bold Additional Notes 
may be added and optionally printed on the certificate, though there is no legal requirement to do this.

Once you have filled in the  information, clicking either the save or print button on the top toolbar will print the certificate.
