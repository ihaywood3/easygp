 This bd file not written - just cutn pasted this old text from FDacc maybe to save typing later.
 The information needed to complete this Diabetic Annual Cycle of Care is incomplete
   missing items are lablled 'OVERDUE'.
   Please note, that measurents such as BP, Height, Weight, and pathology values must exist 
   in your database, so you may have to enter updated values now, then refresh this screen.
   Also, pathology results must exist in the database. If these have been done at another practice 
   it is suggested you ring the company who performed these and arrange a HL7 download to obtain the 
   actual data - it will be needed anyway for statistical analysis later.
   A special note about eyes:
   EasyGP will look through this patients documents and try and find aletter from either an 
   optometrist or an ophthalmologist etc. It won't be able to find this information however if 
   you have mis-spelt the occupation or category for this type of provider, so if you think you 
   have received a letter which isn't being found - go back to contacts and check.
   These data entry fields however, can contain free text if you are certain the eye check has been done.
   Do you wish to save this as an almost completed DACC?
   
   Recalls mention "Diabetes Annual Cycle of Care" as the auto-log keyword
