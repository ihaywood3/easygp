.subsection The Medical Record

What constitutes a good medical record?

Having looked at many definitions on the internet, the following, taken 
from the UK's Medical Protection Society website is simple and one of the best:

.italic Good medical records - whether electronic or handwritten - are essential for the continuity of care
 of your patients. Adequate medical records enable you or somebody else to reconstruct the essential parts of
 each patient contact without reference to memory. They should therefore be comprehensive enough to allow a colleague to 
 carry on where you left off.

Paper records in general practice have been notoriously inadequate in this regard, except in the most 
exceptionally organised practice.

.bold Care Planning 

In an attempt to improve overall patient care, Medicare Australia has in recent years funded specific item numbers for 
general practices to bill medicare when they engage in active 'Care Planning' for their patients.  Unfortunately as many 
medical programs use 'disease templates' to generate care plans, one patient's care plan often ends up looking like that 
of the next.

To aid in care planning,  EasyGP places much emphasis on using a Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR) where the
clinician is encouraged to organise their thinking and and mangement around 'Health Issues' or 'Problems' - 
i.e those things which are important in the management of the patient. EasyGP has incorporated mechanisms to allow you to 
input and easily maintain both an historical summary of these issues and an up-to-date management plan specific to that patient.

.bold Getting an Overview of the Patient's Health

Medical programs vary in their ability to present a 'summary' or  'overview', especially in providing something useful 
for the doctor to quickly review whilst working. In EasyGP this is instantly available from a toolbutton on the main toolbar
which generates an up to date  careplan, including the latest available measurements for the patient 
ranging from  BP, weight, eGFR.
