.subsubsection Deleting a Health Issue

All actions in EasyGP are audited - ie a recording is kept when data is entered, changed or deleted - see 
.xref Auditing
.

To allow for mistakes, a health issue may be deleted, but any attached progress notes will not be removed from the 
clinical notes section but will remain visible though 'struck through'.

To delete a health issue, right mouse click over it on the problem list, and select "Delete" from the popup menu.

You will be given two changes to change your mind.
