.subsection Health Issues

A health issues used within the context of EasyGP constitutes any issues which when relevant to the patient, affect their overall 
management.
Apart from helping you organise your medical record, health issues will later appear on the care plan summary. 
When adding a health issue or problem, you should always keep in the back of your mind, that the purpose is to ensure good 
patient care, and that it should contain enough historical and management information for any other doctor to take over the 
care of the patient should you not be present. In this picture we see a completed data entry for a new health issue.
