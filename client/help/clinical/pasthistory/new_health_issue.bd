.subsubsection Terms and Coding

.bold Selecting a coded term

After clicking the 
.image clinical/pasthistory/new_healthissue_button.png 
 button, the edit area will clear, and the first expected data input will be the coded term for the health issue?
 
 Why the coded term first? Well, often the coded term and the Health issue name will be the same, so this saves typing.

.bold Making the Health Issue different from the Coded Term

In  this case we selected 'Renal Failure NOS as the coded term, but it is not all that descriptive as this patient 
has very poor renal failure, so we can change the actual health issue to something more descriptive, without losing the 
benefit of a the issue being coded.

Now we have something that will give usefull information - the user knowing that this patient would have egFR between 30 and 60.
