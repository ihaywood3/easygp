.bold Accessing the General Notes Page

When you first load a patient's record, the only tab open in the main workspace is the General Notes tab. Only notes 
which are not associated with any particular health issue of importance should be entered here - for example, URTI, 
minor trauma, etc.

.bold Acessing notes for Health Issues

The health issue must have already been entered into EasyGP via the past history or 
.xref health issues
 section, in which 
case it will be on the main problem lists at the bottom left hand side of the screen. When double clicked, a problem 
will be allocated its own progress  notes page selected by the tabs at the top of the workspace such as here, where 
we can see tabs for General Notes, NIDDM and Chronic low back pains:

Clicking any tab will display all notes previously entered for the condition, as well as allow you to enter new 
notes in the notes editor.

Clicking the close button

 will close the current tab.
 
 Should you wish to close a specific tab, or all other tabs, right mouse clicking on any tab will bring up the main 
 workspace tabs menu as shown above.
