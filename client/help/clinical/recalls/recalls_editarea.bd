.subsubsection Recall Edit Area


Though this may seem like a tedious and complex set of options, 99% of the time these will be automatically set, and all that 
you as the user need to do is to pick the recall from a list, and all these will automatically set without intervention from the user. It 
is only if you need to optomize a recall for a particular patient that these need be changed.
