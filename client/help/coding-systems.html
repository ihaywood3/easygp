<li>'Medical classification, or medical coding, is the process of transforming descriptions of medical diagnoses and procedures 
into universal medical code numbers. The diagnoses and procedures are usually taken from a variety of sources within 
the medical record, such as the transcription of the doctor's notes, laboratory results, radiologic results, 
and other sources. Diagnosis codes are used to track diseases, whether they are chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus 
and heart disease, to contagious diseases such as norovirus, the flu, and athlete's foot. These diagnosis and procedure 
codes are used by government health programs, private health insurance companies, workers' compensation carriers and others.'

<b>What happens in practice?</b> <p/>
Having to select a 'code' when making a diagnosis is in all probablity one of the most annoying and hated actions forced upon 
general practitioners by medical programs. Though it should not be so, it is often virtually impossible to find a term which 
makes sense to the user or accurately describes the diagnosis being made or the problem being entered. 
<p/>
The reasons for this are beyond the scope of this document and would be hotly debated by the generators of the coding systems 
or users meticulous enough to not find this a problem.
<p/>
The end result is that the user often just allocates 'any code' or something which is 'near enough' just to get on with 
their work. This action combined with 'templating' leaves us with medical records that are often highly inaccurate and 
similar to the next persons.
<p/>
<b>Which coding system should I use?</b> <p/>
Several 'Free' coding systems are included with EasyGP including ICPC and ICD10, however in the this authors opinion these are 
deficient and tedious to use for general practioners, and it is worthwhile paying a subscription for an 'Australianised' version 
of either ICPC2-Plus or ICD10am.
<p/>
Whichever coding system you select it will be automatically intetegerated into EasyGP but note this critical point:
<p/>
<b>Once you selected a coding system and enter **any** clinical record you may not change the coding system.</b> <p/>
This may change in a future release version of EasyGP but is not guaranteed . See
