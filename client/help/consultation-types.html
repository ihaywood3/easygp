<h2>Consultation Types</h2>
<p/>
For medico-legal reasons the type of consultation should always be set - for example, you may be having 
a phone conversation with the patient, or be part of a conference, and we need the notes to reflect this.
<p/>
On the main toolbar you will notice the consultation type combo box:
<p/>

<p/>
When progress notes are viewed, the type of consultation will be shown for the particular day's notes. 
<p/>
Should you need extra types of consultation please consult the developers and they can be added to the combobox. 
<p/>
There is a 'hidden' consulation type - that of 'legacy data import', so that you will be able to recognise any data that was not 
generated in EasyGP</body></html>
