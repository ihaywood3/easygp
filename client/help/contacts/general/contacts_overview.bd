.section General Concepts

Organisations in EasyGP are structured as follows:

.item
.bold Each organisation will always have a default head office even it it subsequently has no branches. 
 e.g with John Hunter Hospital whatever address you give it becomes the address of its head office
.item
.bold The organisation may have branches, 
a name which is also an alias for  departments, e.g. Cardiology Department, and can have its own address, distinct from the address of it's parent head office. 
Of course it need not have an address, or the address could be simple such as `3rd Floor' 
or another physical address at a different location.
.item
.bold A branch,
 here the cardiology department may then have one or more
.bold employee's
.item
.bold This employee however can be employed in multiple departments, organisations and even could be your patient!

This can be pictorially represented by the following:

.image contacts/organisation_list_showing_duplicate_persons.png

 Dr Big Heart is a person and when first entered he is registered as a person and an employee of John Hunter Hospital. 
He also works at a local cardiology practice, could be employed as a university lecturer and also be your patient


If you allow your staff to put in multiple `Big Heart's' then none of his core data will be linked. If you
change his mobile phone in one entry it will not ripple across to all the other entries. We will see later how to 
avoid this problem.
