.subsubsection Organisations

.bold What is an organisation?

There are dozens and dozens of definitions for an organisation!

EasyGP defines organisation is any entity organised for a common purpose, usually considered to be a profit or not for profit 
business or group, under a common name.

Examples of organisations would be
.item A Public hospital
.item A Company providing services to general practice eg Pathology, radiology or physiotherapy companies
.item Persons practicing under a company name as is common in medicine eg Newcastle Rheumatology could employ several 
specialist rheumatologists
.item A sole trader using his name as a company eg. J.P Smith P/L could have a single employee J.P Smith.


This separation allows you to easily do the following when using EasyGP
.item Search for contact information within organisations quickly, for example you can logically enter data for say a Public 
Hospital and all its departments and branches, and then when needed, very quickly see who are all the say cardiologists in a particular 
department as displayed in the graphic below.
.item Set default providers and branches in sections such as Request Ordering, when you would need to know say the head office 
details, but might send your patients to the local branch and need its phone numbers as well, or print out branches local to 
your postcode on your request forms. Doing this is easier with this hierachical structure.
