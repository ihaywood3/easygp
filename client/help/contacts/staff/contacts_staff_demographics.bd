This needs to be entered either as dd/mm/yyy or any similar combination eg 9/9/53 or 09/9/1953. If the program cannot 
convert your input to a date you will be re-prompted until the data is valid

occupation is 'General Practitioner', but the category given is 'General Practice Staff'. You could (and of course the 
decision is your own as to how you wish to aggregate information) allocate the person to a category 'General Practitioners' etc.

may of course go back at any stage and change any of the information.
