Each staff member may individually set preferences for the provider they want EasyGP to use as the default in sections 
such as Request ordering. Doing this will mean that when typing in a request for say a FBC, the pathology company that you 
wish to use and the branch you wish the patient to attend will automatically appear on the request form. Please read the 
.xref Allocating Categories 
section for more information on the concept of 'Providers'. 
The companies and branches must of course exist in the contacts database first (see 
.xref Other Contacts
), however you will be prompted should you try and enter data that does not yet exist.
