.subsection Gambas

.image developers/gambas/gambas.png

People often say Gambas? Why Gambas? Well for a start it is simple enough for non-programmer's like myself to be productive with,  
it is a rapid development environment, but is still sophisticated enough to produce high quality software.  
The Gambas GUI tools are based on Nokia's (originally Trolltech's) open-source award-winning QT widget-kit which contains widgets as simple as a textbox, 
but as complex as a fully fledged web browser.

Gambas is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions,
a bit like Visual Basic™ (but it is NOT a clone !). You should read the  introduction
on the Gambas website  for more information.

 
.subsubsection Which Version?

 The current stable version is version 2.15.2, however the best version to program with is  the svn version which 
 will ultimately become version 3.0, which is still in alpha stage of development – however don't be put off by the alpha 
 in the title bar because unlike many alpha products – this one is this is very very stable, and a  small 
 team of developers from nearly 20 countries,  lead by Benoit Minisini from France, are ultra-responsive to bug reports 
 (most critical bugs are fixed in <24hours, sometimes within 10 minutes of notification in my experience!), and very open 
 to suggestions on improving the features and functionality of the language and the IDE.

.subsubsection Help and Documentation

Written documentation tends to be a bit sparse despite the fact that Gambas is quite a mature language and has been developed 
for years.

.subsubsection Books

.paragraph A Beginner's Guide To Gambas

An excellent book, written by John W. Rittinghouse, though written a long time ago for Gambas version 1.0, 
is comprehensive, and explains gambas in a simple way. 

It is a worthwhile read for both the novice and the experienced programmer unfamiliar with gambas alike. 
It is available on-line from leading booksellers or as a free download in pdf  form. To obtain this  simply type at 
your terminal the following: 

.centre  wget http://vectorlinux.osuosl.org/Uelsk8s/gambas-beginner-guide.pdf

Use of this book has been granted in perpetutity by John who sadly died last year. The author grants perpetual licence to 
the Gambas user-community for use of the electronic version of this printed work under he terms and conditions of the 
Opencontent Licence printed in the glossary.

I cannot recommend this book highly enough and suggest everyone read it before commencing any work on this project.
