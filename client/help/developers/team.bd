.subsection The  Developers

Whilst not an autocracy, we, the development team recognise that eternal bickering about what should and should not go 
into an open source project usually leads to the projects stagnation or demise, or at the very best, very slow progress. 
Hence the team has agreed on clearly defined roles where 'the buck stops' â€“ i,e he who has a designated role gets the final 
say after other members of the team have provided their input. To this end here is out (relatively autocratic) team 
and their (contradiction in terms) probable roles.
