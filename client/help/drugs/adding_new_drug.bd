.subsubsection Adding a New Drug

The Australian PBS drugs which are supplied with EasyGP and updated monthly will suffice for 99% of your 
prescribing needs, however there are many private medications we also commonly use, for example most 
vaccinations needed for travel purposes are not on the Australian PBS. Also you may have your own 
formulations that you get a chemist to mix up, or want to prescribe creams for skin conditions which are 
not listed on the Australian PBS.

In these situations, you may have to add your own drug, and you can share this drug with EasyGP Central 
where it will be checked and included in drug updates sent to other users.

To Start adding a new drug you will need the product information file. These can be downloaded from 
.link https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/
, and should be added to the product information directory on your file server 
or local machine - this path should have been set in Admin on the Global Preferences tab.

This process can be either quick and simple or at times may seem nearly impossible - due to problems 
with deciding what are the the generic names and associated strengths of some drugs - due to difficulty 
interpretting the product information. It is vital however that this be 
accurate as this information will be printed on your prescriptions, and used internally by EasyGP for 
allergy checking and to supply things like use in pregnancy. To start click the 'Add New' icon

  on the toolbar at the top of the screen

.bold .italic ** If in any doubt, do not add the drug, but email the developers for assistance.**

You will need to search the drug pdf to find most of the drugs details. The combo box at the top of the drug pdf 
may assist you, you could also type in explicit text in the search textbox at the bottom of the pdf display.

.bold The Brand Name
Type in the brand name - the name should be auto-capitalised and when you hit the enter 
key, EasyGP will attempt to find a matching product information file which should appear in the pdf 
viewer on the right hand side of the screen if you named the pdf the same name as the drug
.item
.bold The Company
- this is usally listed in the pdf under the sub-heading of 'Sponsor', usually 
located on the last page. If the company does not exist, the drug cannot be added. You should email the
EasyGP Developers and request the name be added to the drugs database.
.item
.bold The Generic Component(s)
You will have to search the product information for these. This can be very simple e.g 
if adding DI-GESIC you probably already now the drug contains dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride and paracetamol, or extemely difficult if the 
drug contains multiple ingredients. As you type in the Find Generic textbox, EasyGP will try and give you a list of generic names already in 
the database which match what you are starting to type - if you are luckly you will get an exact match. If so, clicking the Add button next to the 
textbox will add the components into the generics grid. If the strenghs are different to those contained in our drug, clicking over the stength will 
allow you to edit the details.

.bold The ATC Name (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System) 
Finding this is usually fairly easy 
if you type in the generic component of your drug, for example, if adding DI-GESCIC, by typing in 'dextrop' you would get this list:

.item
.bold The Formulation
 - i.e tablets, oral liquid, nasal spray. If the drug is a liquid, you will have to enter the amount of liquid and its strength for example the drug may 
 come in 100mls, so the amount is 100, and from the strength combobox you would select say 'mg'.
.item
.bold The Pack Size
  For Syrups or liquid this will be typically '1'. For tablets this is the number of tablets in a pack.
.item
.bold The Schedule
  You will have to search the product information for 'Schedule', usually most drugs are S4, be aware that a small number are S8 so you should check carefully.
