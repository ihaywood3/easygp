<h2>Finding Patients</h2>

</ul>
There are two options when searching for patients
<p/>
<b>Display All Patients </b> <p/>

By clicking on the little search icon a list of all patients will appear in the patients list box. This is  
<b>not recommended </b> as your database could have many thousands of patients. This is equivalent to typing the wildcard character 
'%' in the search textbox (which is also shown above in the picture).
<p/>
<b>Selecting patients by pre-defined criteria</b> <p/>

There are a number of inbuilt queries mechanisms you can type into the patients search box, which is the little 
textbox to the right of the binocular icon shown above.  
<p/>

<ul>
<li><b>Surname,Firstname  </b> 
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>'j smit' gives a list of all patients with  firstname starting with 'j' and surname with 'smit'

</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Surname only </b> 
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">

</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Firstname only </b> 
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">

</ul>
If these fail to work please let us know as though the code is in place they may not yet be 'hooked up'.
