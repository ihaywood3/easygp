<h2>Focus</h2>
<p/>
Gui objects are all those things which make up the screen you are viewing - the labels, textboxes, lists, buttons and so-on. Some objects 
do nothing but sit there for example a label. Others, such as lists have behaviours which allow you to scroll up and down them, and others 
such as textboxes and word processors accept data input which can be later saved by the program.
<p/>
When you click on, or tab to, or arrive at by any means, an object, for example a textbox - then it 'has focus' - i.e it is the centre 
of attention for the moment. So, how do you know that an object has focus?

<table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/focus_textbox_cursor.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">

<table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/focus_txtbox_green.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> Change of background colour - this will (later) be made configurable in EasyGP</ul></td></tr></table><p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/focus_textbox_highlighted.png" /></td><td>

<b>Lists</b> <table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/focus_listbox.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> The line selected will be highlighted by a (usually system wide) foreground color or 'marquee'</ul></td></tr></table><p/>
<b>Change in 3D</b> <p/>
some controls such as panels and buttons may appear:
<p/>
<p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/focus_no_3d.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> Flat when they have no focus</ul></td></tr></table><p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/focus_has_3d.png" /></td><td>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> Raised and outlined when they have no focus</ul></td></tr></table></body></html>
