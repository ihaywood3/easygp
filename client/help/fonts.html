<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p/>
There are a number of mechanisms to adjust the fonts throughout the program, system wide application font, and fonts on 
individual controls
<p/>

<h3>Application Font</h3>

<p/>
You may change the font and font size for the entire application by clicking on the little 
font button, 
<p/>

 located on the lower right hand side of the screen status bar. This setting is immediately applied. 
<p/>

<h3>Fonts for Lists</h3>
 
 In many sections of the program, on the popup menu that you may view by right mouse clicking on 
 the lists, there is an option to change the font for that list. This over-rides any system wide 
 font changes.
 
<p/>
 

<h3>Browser font sizes</h3>
<p/>
Browser windows are used extensively in EasyGP, for example to view progress notes, care plans, reports etc, and as the browser 
contains html, you must zoom up and down to adjust the font sizes as you would in a normal internet browser.
<p/>

Each browser window has icons to expand or shrink the font for that window. 
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="basicconcepts/adjust_fonts_browsers_zoom_out.png" />  makes the font size smaller.
<p/>
The new zoom size will be saved when either its screen is closed, or the application exits.<p/>
