.section Getting EasyGP

At the present time, you can only install a development version of EasyGP and only in a development environment of gambas 3.0 which 
may not be available as a package in your particular distribution.

Mimumum Requirements are

.item  Linux - a distribution of your choice and a working knowledge of linux
.item  Postgresql - a working version of at least 8.3 or greater
.item  Gambas3 - development version  installed on your distribution.

As there are many different ways to get this all working, if you encounter problems, please send your questions to the
 the EasyGP developers list.

.subsection Downloading EasyGP

Currently EasyGP is only available via SVN. The repository is at 
.pre
svn://ozdocit.org/easygp/trunk
.end pre



.imagetext gettingstarted/createprojectsvn.png

.item Fire up gambas3
.item Select new project
.item Select the option of downloading from an svn repository
.item Click the Next button

.end imagetext


.imagetext gettingstarted/createprojectdir.png

.item Select the directory you wish to store the code in
.item Click the Next button on the project creation wizard to continue.
.end imagetext

.imagetext gettingstarted/createprojectdownload.png
.item Copy and paste or type in the svn address and hit return 
.item Watch gambas create the project
.item Be patient as download from the internet can take some time.
.end imagetext


.subsection Building your database



Eventually database packages will be available for the common distros.

.subsubsection Manual build of database

If there isn't a database package for your distro (currently, that's everyone)
you can build a database directly from SQL sources in the SVN repository.
First you need to install 
.link http://postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL
 for your system. Please see your distros documentation for this and ensure that the postmaster
is running and test that you can create and view databases using 
.link http://www.pgadmin.org/ pgAdmin
  before proceeding. All distros will have packages for pgAdmin3.

Next, download the SVN (as above), and fire up a shell. Go to the `trunk' directory
downloaded by SVN and then the `db' subdirectory. There run the install script:

.pre
./install-easygp.sh
.end pre

This should install a working database for most sensible setups of PostgreSQL. The
script will ask you to enter your root password (for Ubuntu that's your user password)
and then an administrator's password for the EasyGP database. (ideally this should
be different to the root password). The administrator user is always called `easygp'.
The console output should be similar to the one shown below.


.image gettingstarted/console.png

Note it is impossible to cover every possible Postgres setup and somebody is bound to
have this script fail on them. If that happens please send a bug report with the 
contents of the file `/tmp/easygp-errors'. You may encounter non-critical errors for example if 
you have manually used the dropdb command in a terminal but not removed the easygp or staff role.

Once you've built the database, you can check it if you like using pgAdmin.

To run easygp you have two options
.item If using the SVN go to the startup folder and set modStartup as the startup form
.item If running an executable simply execute easygp.gambas.

As this will be the first time the program has run, as setup wizard will appear.

.subsection Setup Wizard

If the database has been successfully built, a default user called 'easygp' will have been created. 
If you inspect the database using pgAdmin, it should look something similar to this:

.image gettingstarted/pgadmin-users.png


The user 'easygp' has the permissions necessary to allow you to access the EasyGP database, to add your general practice 
as a new organisation and to create a system administrator.

Note the user 'easygp' is not and will never be a  'staff member' and as such cannot run the clinical sections of the program. 

After the database wizard has been run, you should logon as 'easygp' or the sysadmin you created, and enter any further 
.xref staff members
 or 
.xref organisations
 that you wish.

.include gettingstarted/setup-wizard.bd
.subsection Importing data
.subsection Starting EasyGP

.image gettingstarted/logon.png

When you first run EasyGP you will be presented with the logon screen
.item Host is the address of the server running an easyGP database, either on the local network or 
on the Internet. It will usually be set to the default `localhost' (meaning the same computer), but can be a domain name or an IP address.
.item Database is the name of the database you wish to access, almost always `easygp'.
.item User is your user code, usually your initials. Remember the easygp administrator user is always `easygp'.
.item Password is your assigned password. For the admin user this was entered during the install process in
.xref Building your Database
. Note this adminstrator user can't access clinical screens: for medico-legal reasons any clinical action taken by a user
must be mappable to a real person. user accounts with real people's names can be created through the Contacts
section (
.xref Contacts
) which the administrator does have access to.

.subsection Closing EasyGP

EasyGP can closed like other graphical application by using the button in the far right corner (the appearance varies from system to system)
