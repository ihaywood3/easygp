.section Introduction

The purpose of this  document is to give an overview of the open source medical records project EasyGP which has been 
written initially for the Australian medical general practice environment, though it is hoped it will equally be 
applicable in other similar environments around the world. 

Written in Gambas Basic and using Postgresql as the database backend, its functionality is closely tied to 
Dr Richard Terry's original visual basic client, written way back in the dim distant past of last century in the mid 1990's. 

For several years after the year 2000,  Horst Herb (a general practitioner + IT guru),  Richard Terry  (a Newcastle GP), 
and  Ian Haywood, (a Melbourne-based psychiatry registrar) were involved with the GNUMed project, 
however it became clear after a number of years that the project was progressing in a direction that would ultimately not 
be useful to Australian general practitioners, and was relunctantly abandoned.

In 2008, Richard frustrated by the continuing poor quality of medical software in Australia stumbled upon Gambas, 
and with his background in Basic programming, deciding to take the bull by the horns, took up programming after a break of 
some years, and crafted the outline of what has become EasyGP. 

After presenting this at the nat-div 3020cc Conference in 
June 2009, a small group was formed to advance the development of the program with the ambitious goal or producing a beta 
product towards the end of 2009, or early 2010.
