In this section you should enter the name of the head office or your organisation
usually this will be the general practice you work in.

The setup wizard will assist you by popping up lists of suburbs, and generally prompting 
you for missing information.

Should you later decided you have made a mistake and have not yet completed the setup
you may use the 'Previous' button to re-visit any of the pages. 

After completion of the setup wizard, this information can of course be changed
in the EasyGP Contacts Manager.

.bold A Special note about using categories.

Categories are used extensively in EasyGP to help you organise your information.Here we mean
the type of category you wish your organisation to belong to - usually a 'general practice'.


.subsubsection  The System Administrator

The system administrator should be a trusted member of your staff and should have 
a reasonable knowledge of Information Technology and using computer programs as they 
will be given access rights to all modules and database functions.


.subsubsection  Previewing your setup

You will be presented with a summary of the information you have entered.

This page is the last chance to either go back and change what you are not happy about, or 
to cancel the wizard.
 
Once you click the 'Next' button, the data from the wizard will be written to the database.



.subsubsection Completing the initial setup

At this point you may run easygp, either as the user you entered as sysadmin or as 'easygp' 
the latter of course will not be able to access any clinical records. You may however add more 
staff members, organisations such as hospitals, pathology providers etc,
