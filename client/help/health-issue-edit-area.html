<li><b>The Health Issue</b>  - is the problem you wish to record e.g Hypertension. Note this may or may not be the same as the coded issue, for 
 example if the coded issue was Type 2 Diabetes, your health issue may be 'Poorly controlled NIDDM', ie you can make
 this descriptive enough to convey the sense of the persons condition to third parties.
<li><b>The Coded Term </b>  - is selected from whichever coding system you installed and is mandatory. It is possible however, to add your own 
 terms if they do not exist in the coding system of your choice -see  
<a href="user-terms.html">User Terms</a><li><b>Age Onset </b>  - the age of onset of the condition. If supplied the year of onset will be automatically calculated as a whole year eg 1960
<li><b>Year Onset</b>  - the recommended format for  this is mm/yyyy e.g 09/2008. If you must type in an entire date eg 01/01/1920 then your can.
 When printing out lists of health issues, listing  then you will get nicely formatted 
problem lists. The age of onset will be automatically calculated from the mm/yyyy.

</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>The Checkboxes </b>  - for laterality, causality, operation, and confidential should be self explanatory, but the remainder need special mention.
<li><b>The Historical summary</b>  - is a summary of all relevent events from diagnosis to the present time
<li><b>The Management Plan</b>  - is a summary of all relevent actions needed to manage the patients condition
<li><b>Care Providers</b>  - is a list of person, organisations their diagnostic category and address

</ul>
<b>Risk Factors </b> If the 'risk factor' checkbox is checked, the health item is treated differently when the care plan is generated and it, and 
any associated historical summary and managament plans are grouped with other risk factors. Examples would be cholesterol, 
blood pressure, social disadvantage, tendency toward depression, anxiety about disease.
<p/>
<b>Allocating the Health Issue to be Major/Significant/Inactive</b> This is critical to the functioning of EasyGP. Major health issues should be those that anyone looking after the patient 
need to know and need active daily management. Significant problems could be something like 'chronic back pain', which are not 
critical but cause the patient discomfort or need some sort of active management. 
Inactive problems are those problems needing no current managment but which were an important part of the patient's 
history e.g 'Laminectomy' or 'stent' or 'Hysterectomy'.
