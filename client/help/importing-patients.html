<ul>
<li> Rebuild - will erase any existing patients in the database. This is not possible once the database is being used for clinical purposes
<li> Update  - will attempt to update addresses for existing patients. There may be situations where a person has changed their name or a birthdate was incorrectly input from the original database and has since been corrected. EasyGP 
will attempt to take these possibilities into account and prompt you where ambiguities arise.
<li> Add New since last update - will add only those patients not already present in the database.
</ul>
<b>Data Verification Process</b> <p/>
If everything is satisfactory, click the 'import button'. EasyGP will perform some basic analysis of your data

<ul>
<li> Town/Suburb spell checking - for example it will attempt to replace mis-typed names<li> Postcode check - with insertion of correct or missing postcodes<li> Firstname/Sex check - with insertion of sex<li> Title check if possible, defaulting to Ms or Mr for ages &gt; 18 where marital status obviously cannot be deduced
</ul>
Any errors will be listed below the import error.
<p/>
Once completed you may have to go back to the source database and correct any errors. Once happy click the import button.
