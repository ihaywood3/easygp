Once your results and letters have been electronically downloaded the program will attempt to exactly match the delivered result to a patient's name in your database, or if no exact match is found, will look for likely possibilities based on common errors such as mis-spelt names or reversed names, or same birthdate but different addresses etc.

Clicking on a patient from either list will display the result corresponding to the request highlighted in the .bold delivered list, shown here on the lower right hand side of the picture, and an attempt will be made to match the delivered name against a user synonym.

The result or letter can then be quickly filed, or if some action is needed to be taken, then
the result can be viewed in context of its ordering and you can add progress notes, scratch pad reminders, recalls, or even order another request from this screen before filing. These actions will not interfere with any other patient currently open in your medical record, but will update the relevant sections in a patient's clinical record if open whilst you happen to be filing an incoming result in their name.
