<h2>Keyboard Navigation</h2>
<p/>
When computers first trickled into general practice in the mid 1990's, I spent some time coaxing, co-ercing, and tutoring doctors in the 
clinical use of computers, and spent many hours sitting side by side with them watching them struggle using the graphics user interface. Sadly 
despite all the modern advances, in my more recent visits to practices, and in watching secretarial staff use computers, it seems that very few 
persons have ever grasped the basics of navigating around a graphic user interface, nor the concept of Focus. They spend a staggering amount of 
time jumping from keyboard to mouse, clicking something, going back to the keyboard, looking for a key, and in general making life for themselves 
very difficult indeed, and probabaly tripling the amount of time they need to undertake a particular task.
<p/>
When designing EasyGP we are going to great lengths attempting to make data-entry
<b>**keyboard centric**</b> i.e, to allow you to seamlessly navigate from textbox, to combobox, to checkbox, to list, to the final Save button which will then allow yet 
another keypress - enter - to complete the data input process. 
 
Of course this is not always possible and to date in many places in the program,  as EasyGP is a pre-alpha - not even a beta program, it is yet to be implemented.
 

<h3>Key usage conventions</h3>
 
These are common by and large to windows and unix/linux systems, with one major exception that in linux there are two copy buffers - 
one filled by just swiping the text (no need to use popup menu or Ctrl C) and they other Ctrl C.
<p/>
It should be possible to navigate up and down within 
<a href="the-edit-area.html">the edit area</a> using these keys, including from combo-boxes and checkboxes 
Where this is not possible please let us know and I will insert the code.
<p/>

<ul>
<li>  Enter and Tab  - go down from one control to another<li> Shift Tab  -go up to the next control
</ul>
<b>Combox box</b> <p/>

<ul>
<li> Spacebar - exposes the drop down list<li> Arrow keys go up and down<li> Enter key accepts the item
</ul>
<b>Checkbox</b> <p/>

<ul>
<li> Spacebar switches on and off<li> Enter key move to next control, Shift Tab back to previous control
</ul>
<b>Listboxes and Columnviews</b> <p/>

<ul>
<li> Arrow keys go up and down<li> Enter key accepts the current row as the selected data item and moves to the next CTRL.
</ul>
<b>Special key - the Escape Key</b> <p/>
If you are somewhere you don't want to be, or want to remove a popup for example a form preview from the screen, use ESC.
