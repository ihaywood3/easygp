The clinical section is accessed by clicking on the 'Clinical button' at the top of the side bar.
<p/>
The Toolbar bar will be used to find the patient, display basic patient information and to access all the different 
clinical sections in EasyGP.
<p/>
All progress notes sections look similar to that shown above, here a progress notes editor for general notes. 
Progress notes are added for specific health issues by double clicking on the problem lists at the bottom right hand 
side of the screen.
