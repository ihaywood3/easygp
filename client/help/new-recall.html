<h2>New Recall</h2>

</ul>
<p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="clinical/recalls/recalls_new_recall_for.png" /></td><td><p/>
<p/>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>Clicking the new button, will clear the editing area. You should type in the first few letter of the recall or reminder name - If it 
exists in the database a list will popup.

</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> use the down arrows to scroll down onto the list, resist the tempation to stop and pickup your mouse and click, as this will really slow down your data entry. Hit the enter key when over the item on the list.
</ul></td></tr></table><p/>
If your recall does not exist, it will be saved for future use. 
<b>**NB:use brief names**</b>  as extremely long names do not fit well on lists, for example Screening colonoscopy or 3rd hepatitis B is ok, but 
 tetanus diptheria whooping cough and polio vaccine will cause all sorts of grief!
<p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="clinical/recalls/recalls_new_reason_calc_intervals.png" /></td><td><p/>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> You must supply a default interval for the recall eg 12M, 6W, 2Y which will auto-expand to calculate the date. You may of course type in a complete date instead.

</ul>
</td></tr></table><p/>
If you have previously entered default intervals, then by and large, just selecting an existing recall name will auto-complete the 
entire recall, including, if present, a letter template for more complex recalls such as annual checkups.
