<h2>Patient Demographic Details</h2>
<p/>
Most of this is straightforward. You will be prompted with lists of surnames and firstnames if they exist.
<p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="contacts/patients/patients_firstname_surname.png" /></td><td><p/>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li><b>birthdate</b> This needs to be entered either as dd/mm/yyy or any similar combination eg 9/9/53 or 09/9/1953. If the program cannot 
convert your input to a date you will be re-prompted until the data is valid

</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li><b>Salutation</b> It is surprising how many people do not know this term - it means how the person likes to be addressed for example 
sometimes a person may have disliked their firstname e.g Gladys and has always used their middle name e.g Kathryn, so 
the salutation field would be Kathryn.
