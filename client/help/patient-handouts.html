<h2>Patient Handouts</h2>
<p/>
The patient handout section is, as the name suggests, a respository of patient orientated
literature.
<p/>
Like 
<a href="my-library.html">My Library</a> the files which will be viewed exist under a directory called handouts. The default directory
structure which is setup when you first install EasyGP is the same as My Library, however you 
my delete or add directories as you see fit.
