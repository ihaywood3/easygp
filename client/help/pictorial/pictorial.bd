.subsection  My Library directory structure
.imagetext pictorial/my_library_directory_structure.png

If you examine your new installation directories using a file manager, you will notice that 
under the main easygp directory, there is a main subdirectory called 'library', as shown here. We create a number of directories you will most likely want to use here.

In addition you may create your own directories here,but please note that sub-directories of the directories shown here
.bold will not
show up in the library itself.

Under each of your directories, you should the information you wish to view from within the program.

Recognised file types include text files, pdf files (*.pdf), web pages or html documents (*.html), and the usual images files (*.png, *.bmp, *.jpg, *.jpeg).

It is not currently possible to view word-processor documents from either OpenOffice or Microsoft Word, unless of course Ian haywood does something very clever here.
