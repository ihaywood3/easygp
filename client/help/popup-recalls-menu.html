<h2>Popup Recalls Menu</h2>
<p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="clinical/recalls/recalls_menu.png" /></td><td>All outstanding recalls will be found in the main recalls list - located on the tabbed lists window on the upper right 
side of the screen.
<p/>
During consultations you will complete many of these recalls, or the clinical situation may have changed - for example 
the person may have had a proceedure such as a pap smear somewhere else, or the recall or reminder is no longer needed, or 
simply the patient refuses to have the recall completed.
<p/>
By right mouse clicking on the list, the menu with all its options will appear for your selection.
<p/>
Note particularly that the option 'Mark completed and repeat in..' has automatically included the time interval.
