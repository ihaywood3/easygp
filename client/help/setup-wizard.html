<h2>Setup Wizard</h2>
<p/>
If the database has been successfully built, a default user called 'easygp' will have been created. 
If you inspect the database using pgAdmin, it should look something similar to this:
<p/>

<p/>
The user 'easygp' has the permissions necessary to allow you to access the EasyGP database, to add your general practice 
as a new organisation and to create a system administrator.
<p/>
Note the user 'easygp' is not and will never be a  'staff member' and as such cannot run the clinical sections of the program. 
<p/>
After the database wizard has been run, you should logon as 'easygp' or the sysadmin you created, and enter any further 
<a href="staff-members.html">staff members</a> or 
<a href="organisations.html">organisations</a> that you wish.
