<h2>Splitters</h2>
<p/>
As mentioned in the previous section splitters enable the user to re-size area's of the screen and its contents, and there are two 
types:
<p/>
<p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/vertical_splitter.png" /></td><td><p/>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> <b>A Vertical Splitter </b>  is a container that lays out its children vertically, and that allows the user to resize them by dragging the boundary between them
</ul></td></tr></table><p/>
<table><tr><td><img src="basicconcepts/horizontal_splitter.png" /></td><td><p/>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li> <b>A Horizontal Splitter </b> is a container that lays out its children horizontally, and that allows the user to resize them by dragging the boundary between them. 
</ul></td></tr></table><p/>
EasyGP makes extensive use of splitters and will automatically save your resized screen area's on exit. If you find your self in a
 section of EasyGP and the screen design looks a little odd, its possible you have accidentally moved a splitter right up to the top 
or out to one edge, and hidden its contents - go take a look, grab the line and drag it back.

This help file you are reading now, has a vertical splitter separating the chapters/topics from the text you are reading - try 
adjusting this as practice in using splitters.
