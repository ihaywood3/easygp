It is highly recommended that users keep photo's of their patient's wherever possible for identification purposes, to select the option to show a pictorial 
list, when the patient is selected, and to enforce the 'confirm patient identify' option.

Of course, if you believe you are infallible, and could never make a mistake selecting your patients, feel free to use the alternative options as described below.

If you decide to use the pictorial lists, you will have acknowlege the patient identity by both clicking on the patient's photo-id and selecting OK.

If this is checked, then when searching for a patient, and only a single patient name is found, you will have to confirm the identity of the patient.
