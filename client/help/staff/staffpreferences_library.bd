.bold Network Path to the Library Files

Because most of us work in multi-room surgeries, it is recommended that your Library files be kept on your file server, that way, no matter which workstation you are at 
you will be able to access the same files in the library.

The pathway for this is set by the system administrator, who can access this via the global perferences tab in the Administrator section, accesses from the sidebar menu.

.bold Keeping a local copy of the Library on your machine.

There may be times when the network pathway is un-available, for instance if you use a  laptop, and it is taken out of the surgery.

You can if you wish, backup the library files to your local machine, and set this pathway in this section. EasyGP will first attempt to look up the Library on the network 
but if this fails, then it will try and find a local copy in the directory you supply here.


.bold The Library Home Page

You may set a default web address to use as your home page, as shown in this graphic:
