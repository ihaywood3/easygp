When you first run EasyGP you will be presented with the logon screen

<ul>
<li> Host is the address of the server running an easyGP database, either on the local network or on the Internet. It will usually be set to the default `localhost' (meaning the same computer), but can be a domain name or an IP address.
<li> Database is the name of the database you wish to access, almost always `easygp'.<li> User is your user code, usually your initials. Remember the easygp administrator user is always `easygp'.<li> Password is your assigned password. For the admin user this was entered during the install process in<a href="building-your-database.html">Building your Database</a>. Note this adminstrator user can't access clinical screens: for medico-legal reasons any clinical action taken by a user
must be mappable to a real person. user accounts with real people's names can be created through the Contacts
section (
<a href="contacts.html">Contacts</a>) which the administrator does have access to.

</ul>
