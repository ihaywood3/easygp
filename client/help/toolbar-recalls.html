<h2>Toolbar Recalls</h2>
<p/>
<img src="clinical/recalls/recalls_on_toolbar.png" /><p/>
Not all recalls will end up being posted or emailed out to the patient. Many will be handled opportunistically when 
the patient visits.
<p/>
To act as a constant reminder, a small list sits on the extreme right of the main clinical toolbar.
<p/>
Recalls or reminders are listed in order of when they are due from earlier to later, top to bottom.
