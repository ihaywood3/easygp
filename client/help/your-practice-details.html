In this section you should enter the name of the head office or your organisation
usually this will be the general practice you work in.
<p/>
The setup wizard will assist you by popping up lists of suburbs, and generally prompting 
you for missing information.
<p/>
Should you later decided you have made a mistake and have not yet completed the setup
you may use the 'Previous' button to re-visit any of the pages. 
<p/>
After completion of the setup wizard, this information can of course be changed
in the EasyGP Contacts Manager.

<b>A Special note about using categories.</b> <p/>
Categories are used extensively in EasyGP to help you organise your information.Here we mean
the type of category you wish your organisation to belong to - usually a 'general practice'.
