From Horst for Richard

btrees are a poor choice for data that is likely to added more or less
sequentially, because the tree keeps degenerating into a list and
needs to be constantly reorganized. However, hasthables are not good
for anything that you want to search for with partial matches, or what
you need to display or search for in a particular sequence.
As a rule of thumb, btrees mostly do the trick, will support most
query types, and hence they are used by default if you don't specify
the index.
Suggest unless you know exactly what you want to achieve to simply use
CREATE INDEX without specifying the index type.
