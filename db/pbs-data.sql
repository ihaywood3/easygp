Further reassessments are to be undertaken and documented yearly. Treatment with dornase alfa should cease if there is not agreement of benefit as there is always the possibility of harm from unnecessary use\nNOTE: It is highly desirable that all patients be included in the national cystic fibrosis patient data-base.	3201
6120D	Grandfather  -  for patients less than five years of age who initiated dornase alfa prior to listing  Treatment of cystic fibrosis in a patient less than 5 years of age who initiated treatment with dornase alfa prior to 1 November 2009 and for whom a comprehensive assessment, involving the patient's family, the treating physician and an additional independent member of the cystic fibrosis treatment team, documents agreement that dornase alfa treatment is continuing to produce worthwhile benefit. Further reassessments are to be undertaken and documented yearly. Treatment with dornase alfa should cease if there is not agreement of benefit as there is always the possibility of harm from unnecessary use\nNOTE: It is highly desirable that all patients be included in the national cystic fibrosis patient data-base.	3202
6120D	Treatment of cystic fibrosis in a patient less than 5 years of age who has:  (1) A severe clinical course with frequent respiratory exacerbations or chronic respiratory symptoms (including chronic or recurrent cough, wheeze or tachypnoea) requiring frequent hospital admissions more frequently than 3 times per year; or  (2) Significant bronchiectasis on chest high resolution computed tomography scan; or  (3) Severe cystic fibrosis bronchiolitis with persistent wheeze non-responsive to conventional medicines; or  (4) Severe physiological deficit measure by forced oscillation technique or multiple breath nitrogen washout and failure to respond to conventional therapy.   In order for the patient to be eligible for participation in the HSD program, the following conditions must be met:  (1) The patient must be assessed at a cystic fibrosis clinic/centre which is under the supervision of specialist respiratory physicians with experience and expertise in the management of cystic fibrosis, and the prescribing of dornase alfa under the HSD program is limited to such physicians. If attendance at such a unit is not possible because of geographical isolation, management (including prescribing) may be by specialist physician or paediatrician in consultation with such a unit;  (2) Following an initial 6 months therapy, a comprehensive assessment must be undertaken and documented involving the patient, the patient's family, the treating physician and an additional independent member of the cystic fibrosis treatment team to establish agreement that dornase alfa treatment is continuing to produce worthwhile benefit. Treatment with dornase alfa should cease if there is not agreement of benefit as there is always the possibility of harm from unnecessary use.

6120D	Use by cystic fibrosis patients who satisfy all of the following criteria:  (1) are 5 years of age or older;  (2) have a FVC greater than 40% predicted for age, gender and height;  (3) have evidence of chronic suppurative lung disease (cough and sputum most days of the week, or greater than 3 respiratory tract infections of more than 2 weeks' duration in any 12 months, or objective evidence of obstructive airways disease);  (4) are participating in a 4 week trial as detailed below or have achieved a 10% or greater improvement in FEV1 (compared to baseline established prior to dornase alfa treatment) after a 4 week trial.   In order for patients to be eligible for participation in the HSD program, the following conditions must be met:  (1) Patients must be assessed at cystic fibrosis clinics/centres which are under the control of specialist respiratory physicians with experience and expertise in the management of cystic fibrosis and the prescribing of dornase alfa under the HSD program is limited to such physicians.  If attendance at such units is not possible because of geographical isolation, management (including prescribing) may be by specialist physician or paediatrician in consultation with such a unit;  (2) The measurement of lung function is to be conducted by independent (other than the treating doctor) experienced personnel at established lung function testing laboratories, unless this is not possible because of geographical isolation;  (3) Prior to dornase alfa therapy, a baseline measurement of FEV1 must be undertaken during a stable period of the disease;  (4) Initial therapy is limited to 4 weeks' treatment with dornase alfa at a dose of 2.5 mg daily;  (5) At or towards the end of the initial 4 weeks' trial, patients must be reassessed and a further FEV1 measurement be undertaken (single test under conditions as above). Patients who achieve a 10% or greater improvement in FEV1 (compared to baseline established prior to dornase alfa treatment) are eligible for continued subsidy under the HSD program at a dose of 2.5 mg daily;  (6) Patients who fail to meet a 10% or greater improvement in FEV1 after the initial 4 weeks' treatment at a dose of 2.5 mg daily, may have 1 further trial in the next 12 months but not before 3 months after the initial trial;  (7) Following an initial 6 months' therapy, a global assessment must be undertaken involving the patient, the patient's family (in the case of paediatric patients) and the treating physician(s) to establish that all agree that dornase alfa treatment is continuing to produce worthwhile benefits. (Dornase alfa therapy should cease if there is not general agreement of benefit as there is always the possibility of harm from unnecessary use.) Further reassessments are to be undertaken at six-monthly intervals;  (8) Other aspects of treatment, such as physiotherapy, must be continued;  (9) Where there is documented evidence that a patient already receiving dornase alfa therapy would have met the criteria for subsidy (i.e. satisfied the criteria for the 4 week trial and achieved a 10% or greater improvement in FEV1) then the patient is eligible to continue treatment under the HSD program. Where such evidence is not available, patients will need to satisfy the initiation and continuation criteria as for new patients. (Four weeks is considered a suitable wash-out period)\nNOTE: It is highly desirable that all patients be included in the national cystic fibrosis patient data-base.	1507

All authority applications for continuing treatment with etanercept must be in writing and must include sufficient information to determine the patient's response according to the above criteria. The date of the joint assessment must be provided.   Only 6 months of treatment per application will be approved. Applications for continuing treatment with etanercept should be made prior to the completion of 16 weeks of treatment to ensure continuity for those patients who meet the criteria.   Patients who fail to demonstrate an adequate response, as specified in the criteria for continuing treatment with etanercept, will not be eligible to recommence treatment with etanercept within 12 months of the date on which treatment was ceased.   Withdrawal of treatment with etanercept should be considered in patients who have achieved and sustained complete remission of disease for 12 months. Subsequent applications for PBS-subsidised re-treatment with etanercept will be subject to the authority conditions applying to initial treatment and will not be authorised within 12 months of the date on which treatment with etanercept was ceased.   Where re-treatment with etanercept after a break in PBS-subsidised treatment with the drug is being sought, the reason for and date of cessation of the previous treatment course with etanercept must be included in the application	1781

(Note: use of alternative DMARDs in children is dependent on approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as age restrictions may apply.)   Severe intolerance is defined as intractable nausea and vomiting and general malaise unresponsive to manoeuvres, including reducing or omitting concomitant NSAIDs on the day of methotrexate administration, use of folic acid supplementation, or administering the dose of methotrexate in 2 divided doses over 24 hours.   Toxicity is defined as evidence of hepatotoxicity with repeated elevations of transaminases, bone marrow suppression temporally related to methotrexate use, pneumonitis, or serious sepsis.   The following criteria must be met in order to demonstrate failure to achieve an adequate response to either of the above treatment regimens:  (a) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; OR  (b) at least 4 active joints from the following list:  (i) elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or  (ii) shoulder, cervical spine and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   If treatment with methotrexate alone or in combination with another DMARD is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, or intolerance develops during the period of use such that permanent withdrawal is necessary and a suitably effective treatment regimen cannot be implemented, this exempts the requirement to demonstrate an inadequate response within the time period specified above for these agents.   The authority application must be in writing and must include the information used to determine the patient's eligibility under the criteria above. The date of the joint assessment must be provided.   Only 16 weeks of treatment will be approved. The assessment of the patient's response to initial treatment should be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated	1779

An adequate response to treatment is defined as:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline;  AND either of the following:  (i) a reduction in the total active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline, where baseline is at least 20 active joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the number of the following major active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment will be approved under this restriction.   At the time of the authority application, medical practitioners should request the appropriate quantity of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide sufficient for a single infusion at a dose of 3 mg per kg.  Up to a maximum of 2 repeats may be authorised.   Where fewer than 2 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   All applications for continuing treatment with infliximab must include a measurement of response to the prior course of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with infliximab, it must be accompanied by an assessment of response to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with an initial treatment course.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with infliximab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial infliximab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	2849
6397Q	Initial 1 (new patients)  Application for initial PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab, in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received no prior PBS-subsidised treatment with a bDMARD for this condition in this treatment cycle; and  (c) have failed to achieve an adequate response to the following treatments:  (i) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly; and  (ii) methotrexate (at a minimum dose of 7.5 mg weekly), in combination with 2 other non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for a minimum of 3 months; and  (iii) a minimum of 3 months' treatment with:   -  leflunomide; or   -  cyclosporin.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of the accepted toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L;  AND either  (i) a total active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a signed patient acknowledgement.   A maximum of 22 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   At the time of the authority application, medical practitioners should request the appropriate quantity of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide sufficient for a single infusion at a dose of 3 mg per kg.  Up to a maximum of 3 repeats may be authorised.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 22 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Assessment of a patient's response to an initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.  This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with infliximab.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with infliximab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial infliximab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Where the term bDMARD appears in the following notes and restrictions it refers to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab), the interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra) and the T-cell co-stimulation modulator (abatacept).   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs at any 1 time.   PBS-subsidised infliximab, anakinra, rituximab and abatacept must be used in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly. Where a patient cannot tolerate 7.5 mg of methotrexate weekly, they are only eligible to receive PBS-subsidised etanercept and adalimumab.   In order to be eligible to receive PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab, a patient must have already failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 course of treatment with a PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist.   From 1 March 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a Treatment Cycle where they may trial PBS-subsidised bDMARD agents without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Treatment Cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a bDMARD while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment prior to 1 March 2008 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2008.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised bDMARD more than once.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.   For patients who have failed PBS-subsidised treatment with 3 bDMARDs prior to 1 March 2008 please contact Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270.   The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a bDMARD under the new Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new Treatment Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   If patients fail to respond to a particular bDMARD within a single Treatment Cycle, they are not eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with that drug until they commence the next Cycle.   (1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy after 1 March 2008.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in this Treatment Cycle and wishes to commence such therapy, excluding rituximab (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) bDMARD therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific bDMARD following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for etanercept, adalimumab, anakinra and abatacept, 22 weeks of therapy for infliximab and 2 infusions of rituximab.   From 1 March 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment (excluding rituximab) following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients must be assessed following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 4 weeks.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised bDMARD (excluding rituximab) treatment it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Rituximab patients:  A further application may be submitted to Medicare Australia 24 weeks after the first infusion.  New baselines may be submitted with this application if appropriate.   (b) Continuing treatment.  Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific bDMARD (excluding rituximab), a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing bDMARD treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted bDMARD supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients:  A patient may qualify to receive a further course of treatment (every 24 weeks) with this agent providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion of their most recent treatment with rituximab. The patient remains eligible to receive a course of rituximab every 24 weeks providing they continue to demonstrate a response as specified in the restriction.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised bDMARD is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate bDMARD within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the joint count) or the prior non-bDMARD therapy requirements.  However the requirement for concomitant treatment with methotrexate, where it applies, must be met for each bDMARD trialled.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   A patient may trial an alternate bDMARD at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a bDMARD at the time of the application.  However, they cannot swap to a particular bDMARD if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same Treatment Cycle.   In order to trial rituximab, a patient must have trialled and failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   PBS subsidy does not allow for patients to receive treatment with another PBS-subsidised biological agent during the required treatment-free period applying to patients who have demonstrated a response to their most recent course of rituximab.  This means that patients who have demonstrated a response to a course of rituximab must have a PBS-subsidised biological therapy treatment-free period of at least 22 weeks, immediately following the second infusion, before swapping to an alternate bDMARD.  Patients who fail to respond to rituximab and who qualify and wish to trial a course of an alternate bDMARD may do so without having to have any treatment-free period.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate bDMARD should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the bDMARD the patient is ceasing.	3221
6397Q	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement)  Application for an initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab, in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment for this condition in this treatment cycle and are eligible to receive further bDMARD therapy.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Applications for patients who have received PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab within this treatment cycle and who wish to re-commence therapy with this drug within this same cycle, must be accompanied by evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised infliximab treatment, within the timeframes specified below.   A maximum of 22 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   At the time of the authority application, medical practitioners should request the appropriate quantity of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide sufficient for a single infusion at a dose of 3 mg per kg.  Up to a maximum of 3 repeats may be authorised.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 22 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised infliximab treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised infliximab treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with infliximab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial infliximab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle\nNOTE: (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the joint count, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a bDMARD.  However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. more than 20 active joints), response will be determined according to the reduction in the total number of active joints.  Where the baseline is determined on total number of major joints, the response must be demonstrated on the total number of major joints.   The baseline joint and blood counts should be performed whilst the patient is still on treatment or within 1 month of ceasing prior treatment.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent Treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with at least 1 non-biological DMARD, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR and/or CRP levels and the active joint count are measured.   (5)  Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab or abatacept.   From 1 March 2008, a patient who commenced treatment with rituximab for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 7 March 2007 or abatacept for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 1 November 2007 and who was 'grandfathered' on to PBS-subsidised therapy, and who continues to receive treatment in the same Treatment Cycle, will have further applications for treatment with rituximab or abatacept assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.   A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once.  A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with abatacept will be authorised under this criterion.   'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first Treatment Cycle.  For the second and subsequent Cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that applies to a new patient.  See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2848
6399T	Patients naive to interferon based therapies (non-pegylated or pegylated)   Treatment, managed by an accredited treatment centre, of chronic hepatitis C in patients 18 years or older who have compensated liver disease and who have received no prior interferon alfa or peginterferon alfa treatment for hepatitis C and who satisfy all of the following criteria:  (1) Documented chronic hepatitis C infection (repeatedly anti-HCV positive and HCV RNA positive);  (2) Female patients of child-bearing age are not pregnant, not breast-feeding, and both patient and their partner are using effective forms of contraception (one for each partner). Male patients and their partners are using effective forms of contraception (one for each partner). Female partners of male patients are not pregnant.  For patients with genotype 2 or 3 hepatitis C without hepatic cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis, the treatment course is limited to 24 weeks. For hepatitis C patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 and those genotype 2 or 3 patients with hepatic cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis, the treatment course is limited to 48 weeks.  Patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 who are eligible for 48 weeks of treatment may only continue treatment after the first 12 weeks if the result of an HCV RNA quantitative assay (performed at the same laboratory using the same test) shows that the plasma HCV RNA has become undetectable or the viral load has decreased by at least a 2 log drop. (An HCV RNA assay at week 12 is unnecessary for genotype 2 and 3 patients because of the high likelihood of early viral response by week 12).  Patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 who are viral positive at week 12 but have attained at least a 2 log drop in viral load may only continue treatment after the first 24 weeks of treatment if plasma HCV RNA is not detectable by an HCV RNA qualitative assay at week 24. Similarly, genotype 2 or 3 patients with hepatic cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis may only continue treatment after the first 24 weeks if plasma HCV RNA is not detectable by an HCV RNA qualitative assay at week 24. An HCV RNA qualitative assay at week 24 is unnecessary for those patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 who became viral negative at week 12\nNOTE: Treatment centres are required to have access to the following appropriate specialist facilities for the provision of clinical support services for hepatitis C:  (a) a nurse educator/counsellor for patients; and  (b) 24 hour access by patients to medical advice; and  (c) an established liver clinic; and  (d) facilities for safe liver biopsy.	3055

The application must include details of the NSAIDs trialled, their doses and duration of treatment.  If the NSAID dose is less than the maximum recommended dose in the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, the application must include the reason a higher dose cannot be used.   If treatment with NSAIDs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, the application must provide details of the contraindication.   If intolerance to NSAID treatment develops during the relevant period of use which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, the application must provide details of the nature and severity of this intolerance.  Details of the toxicities, including severity, which will be accepted for the purposes of administering this restriction can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   For details on the appropriate minimum exercise program that will be accepted for the purposes of administering this restriction, please refer to the Medicare Australia website at www.medicareaustralia.gov.au.   The following criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated at the time of the initial application:  (a) a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) of at least 4 on a 0-10 scale; AND  (b) an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 10 mg per L.   The BASDAI must be determined at the completion of the 3 month NSAID and exercise trial, but prior to ceasing NSAID treatment. The BASDAI must be no more than 1 month old at the time of initial application.   Both ESR and CRP measures should be provided with the initial treatment application and both must be no more than 1 month old. If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reason this criterion cannot be satisfied.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which must include the following:  (i) a copy of the radiological report confirming Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis; and  (ii) a completed BASDAI Assessment Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au]; and  (iii) a completed Exercise Program Self Certification Form included in the supporting information form; and  (iv) a signed patient acknowledgment form.  Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment with the TNF-alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab) for ankylosing spondylitis will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   The assessment of the patient's response to the initial course of treatment must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment and submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the response assessment is not submitted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.   A maximum of 18 weeks of treatment with infliximab will be approved under this criterion.   At the time of the authority application, the doctor should request the appropriate number of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide for a single infusion at a dose of 5 mg per kg.  Up to a maximum of 3 repeats will be authorised.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 18 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2494

To demonstrate a response to treatment the application must be accompanied by the results of the most recent course of TNF-alfa antagonist therapy within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction after 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.  Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction prior to 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following at least 4 weeks of treatment. These assessments must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date the course was ceased.   If the response assessment to the previous course of TNF-alfa antagonist treatment is not submitted as detailed above, the patient will be deemed to have failed therapy with that particular course of TNF-alfa antagonist.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes a completed BASDAI Assessment Form with certification by the prescriber and the patient that the patient did not have access to their baseline BASDAI at the time of their assessment.

6496X	Continuing treatment  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults:  (1) who have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised biological agent for this condition in the current Treatment Cycle was with infliximab; and  (3) who, at the time of application, demonstrate an adequate response to treatment with infliximab.   An adequate response to treatment with infliximab is defined as:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline; AND either of the following:  (i) a reduction in the total active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline, where baseline is at least 20 active joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the number of the following major active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   All applications for continuing treatment with infliximab must include a measurement of response to the prior course of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with infliximab, it must be accompanied by an assessment of response to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with the initial treatment course.   At the time of the authority application, medical practitioners should request the appropriate quantity of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide sufficient for a single infusion at a dose of 5 mg per kg.  Up to a maximum of 2 repeats may be authorised.

Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with infliximab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2955
6496X	Initial 1  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle; and  (3) have failed to achieve an adequate response to:  (a) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly for a minimum period of 3 months; and  (b) sulfasalazine at a dose of at least 2 g per day for a minimum period of 3 months; or  (c) leflunomide at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for a minimum period of 3 months.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of acceptable toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au).   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form.

8637N	Initial 1 (new patients)  Application for initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received no prior PBS-subsidised treatment with a bDMARD for this condition in this treatment cycle; and  (c) have failed to achieve an adequate response to the following treatments:  (i) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly; and  (ii) methotrexate (at a minimum dose of 7.5 mg weekly), in combination with 2 other non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for a minimum of 3 months; and  (iii) a minimum of 3 months' treatment with:   -  leflunomide; or   -  cyclosporin.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of the accepted toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L;  AND either  (i) a total active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a signed patient acknowledgement.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Assessment of a patient's response to an initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.  This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with etanercept.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial etanercept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Where the term bDMARD appears in the following notes and restrictions it refers to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab), the interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra) and the T-cell co-stimulation modulator (abatacept).   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs at any 1 time.   PBS-subsidised infliximab, anakinra, rituximab and abatacept must be used in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly. Where a patient cannot tolerate 7.5 mg of methotrexate weekly, they are only eligible to receive PBS-subsidised etanercept and adalimumab.   In order to be eligible to receive PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab, a patient must have already failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 course of treatment with a PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist.   From 1 March 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a Treatment Cycle where they may trial PBS-subsidised bDMARD agents without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Treatment Cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a bDMARD while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment prior to 1 March 2008 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2008.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised bDMARD more than once.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.   For patients who have failed PBS-subsidised treatment with 3 bDMARDs prior to 1 March 2008 please contact Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270.   The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a bDMARD under the new Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new Treatment Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   If patients fail to respond to a particular bDMARD within a single Treatment Cycle, they are not eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with that drug until they commence the next Cycle.   (1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy after 1 March 2008.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in this Treatment Cycle and wishes to commence such therapy, excluding rituximab (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) bDMARD therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific bDMARD following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for etanercept, adalimumab, anakinra and abatacept, 22 weeks of therapy for infliximab and 2 infusions of rituximab.   From 1 March 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment (excluding rituximab) following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients must be assessed following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 4 weeks.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised bDMARD (excluding rituximab) treatment it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Rituximab patients:  A further application may be submitted to Medicare Australia 24 weeks after the first infusion.  New baselines may be submitted with this application if appropriate.   (b) Continuing treatment.  Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific bDMARD (excluding rituximab), a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing bDMARD treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted bDMARD supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients:  A patient may qualify to receive a further course of treatment (every 24 weeks) with this agent providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion of their most recent treatment with rituximab. The patient remains eligible to receive a course of rituximab every 24 weeks providing they continue to demonstrate a response as specified in the restriction.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised bDMARD is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate bDMARD within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the joint count) or the prior non-bDMARD therapy requirements.  However the requirement for concomitant treatment with methotrexate, where it applies, must be met for each bDMARD trialled.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   A patient may trial an alternate bDMARD at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a bDMARD at the time of the application.  However, they cannot swap to a particular bDMARD if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same Treatment Cycle.   In order to trial rituximab, a patient must have trialled and failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   PBS subsidy does not allow for patients to receive treatment with another PBS-subsidised biological agent during the required treatment-free period applying to patients who have demonstrated a response to their most recent course of rituximab.  This means that patients who have demonstrated a response to a course of rituximab must have a PBS-subsidised biological therapy treatment-free period of at least 22 weeks, immediately following the second infusion, before swapping to an alternate bDMARD.  Patients who fail to respond to rituximab and who qualify and wish to trial a course of an alternate bDMARD may do so without having to have any treatment-free period.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate bDMARD should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the bDMARD the patient is ceasing.	3224
8637N	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement)  Application for an initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment for this condition in this treatment cycle and are eligible to receive further bDMARD therapy.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Applications for patients who have received PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept within this treatment cycle and who wish to re-commence therapy with this drug within this same cycle, must be accompanied by evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment, within the timeframes specified below.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial etanercept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle\nNOTE: (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the joint count, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a bDMARD.  However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. more than 20 active joints), response will be determined according to the reduction in the total number of active joints.  Where the baseline is determined on total number of major joints, the response must be demonstrated on the total number of major joints.   The baseline joint and blood counts should be performed whilst the patient is still on treatment or within 1 month of ceasing prior treatment.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent Treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with at least 1 non-biological DMARD, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR and/or CRP levels and the active joint count are measured.   (5)  Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab or abatacept.   From 1 March 2008, a patient who commenced treatment with rituximab for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 7 March 2007 or abatacept for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 1 November 2007 and who was 'grandfathered' on to PBS-subsidised therapy, and who continues to receive treatment in the same Treatment Cycle, will have further applications for treatment with rituximab or abatacept assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.   A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once.  A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with abatacept will be authorised under this criterion.   'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first Treatment Cycle.  For the second and subsequent Cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that applies to a new patient.  See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2845
8637N	Initial treatment, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of patients aged 18 years or older with a documented history of severe active polyarticular course juvenile chronic arthritis with onset prior to the age of 18 years; AND  (a) who have signed a patient agreement form indicating that they understand and acknowledge that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if the predetermined response criteria do not support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment; AND  (b) who have failed to achieve an adequate response to methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly; AND  (c) who have failed to achieve an adequate response to methotrexate, in combination with 2 other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for a minimum of 3 months; AND  (d) who have subsequently failed to achieve an adequate response following a minimum of 3 months' treatment with:  (i) leflunomide; or  (ii) cyclosporin.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, or intolerance of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal develops during the relevant period of use, the patient is exempted from demonstrating an inadequate response to the above treatment regimens. Details of the contraindication or intolerance, including the degree of toxicity, must be provided at the time of application.   The following criteria must be met in order to demonstrate failure to achieve an adequate response:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder, cervical spine and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).    If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be in writing and must include sufficient information to determine the patient's eligibility according to the above criteria.  The date of joint assessment must be provided.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial authority application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 4 months of treatment may be requested by telephone. Under no circumstances will telephone approvals be granted for initial or continuing authority applications, or for treatment that would otherwise extend the initial treatment period beyond 4 months.   The assessment of the patient's response to the initial course of treatment should be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated. Applications for continuing treatment with etanercept should be made prior to the completion of 16 weeks of treatment to ensure continuity for those patients who meet the criteria	3225
8638P	Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of patients aged 18 years or older with a documented history of severe active polyarticular course juvenile chronic arthritis with onset prior to the age of 18 years, who, at the time of application, demonstrate an adequate response to treatment with etanercept as manifested by:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline; AND 1 or more of the following:  (i) an active joint count of fewer than 10 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline; or  (iii) a reduction in the number of the following active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder, cervical spine and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   All authority applications for continuing treatment with etanercept must be in writing and must include sufficient information to determine the patient's response according to the above criteria. The date of assessment of the patient must be provided.   Patients who fail to demonstrate an adequate response, as specified in the criteria for continuing treatment with etanercept, will not be eligible to recommence treatment with etanercept within 12 months of the date on which treatment was ceased.   Where re-treatment with etanercept after a break in PBS-subsidised treatment with the drug is being sought, the reason for and date of cessation of the previous treatment course with etanercept must be included in the application	1910

8638P	Continuing treatment  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults:  (a) who have a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) who have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment with etanercept; and  (c) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in this treatment cycle was with etanercept.   An adequate response to treatment is defined as:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline;  AND either of the following:  (i) a reduction in the total active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline, where baseline is at least 20 active joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the number of the following major active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment will be approved under this restriction.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   All applications for continuing treatment with etanercept must include a measurement of response to the prior course of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with etanercept, it must be accompanied by an assessment of response to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with an initial treatment course.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial etanercept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	2846

If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of the accepted toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L;  AND either  (i) a total active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a signed patient acknowledgement.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Assessment of a patient's response to an initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.  This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with adalimumab.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial adalimumab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	3223
8737W	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement)  Application for an initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment for this condition in this treatment cycle and are eligible to receive further bDMARD therapy.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Applications for patients who have received PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab within this treatment cycle and who wish to re-commence therapy with this drug within this same cycle, must be accompanied by evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment, within the timeframes specified below.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial adalimumab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	2842

Response is defined as an improvement from baseline of at least 2 of the BASDAI and 1 of the following:  (a) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (b) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L; or  (c) an ESR or CRP measurement reduced by at least 20% from baseline.   For a 'grandfather' patient who does not have baselines prior to commencing treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist, see Note 5 for a definition of response to treatment.   Where only 1 acute phase reactant measurement is supplied in the first application for PBS-subsidised treatment, that same marker must be measured and supplied in all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction after 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.  Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction prior to 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following at least 4 weeks of treatment.   Applications for continuing treatment must be made in writing and should be posted to Medicare Australia no less than 2 weeks prior to the completion of the current treatment course.

9033K	Initial 1  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle; and  (3) have failed to achieve an adequate response to:  (a) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly for a minimum period of 3 months; and  (b) sulfasalazine at a dose of at least 2 g per day for a minimum period of 3 months; or  (c) leflunomide at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for a minimum period of 3 months.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of acceptable toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au).   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form. Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) for adult patients with severe active psoriatic arthritis.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological agents at any 1 time.  Where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab.   From 1 August 2006, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare, when swapping to the alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   Following demonstration of response to initial treatment, these biological agents are available under the PBS for continuing treatment as set out in the continuing treatment restriction for each agent.   Once patients have either failed or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a single Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy before they are eligible to commence another Cycle [further details are under '(5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' below].   The 5-year break in therapy will be measured from the date the last approval for PBS-subsidised treatment was granted in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Cycle.   Within the same Cycle, patients are not allowed to fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once. Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for any biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent which they have not previously failed, if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe active psoriatic arthritis after 1 August 2006.   (1)  Initial treatment.   Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); and  (ii) patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; and  (iii) patients wish to re-commence treatment with a specific biological agent following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that specific agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment for non-grandfather patients will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for all agents except for infliximab, for which a maximum of 22 weeks will be authorised.  It is recommended that patients be reviewed in the month prior to completing their course of initial treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological agent supply.   Patients must be assessed for response to any course of PBS-subsidised initial treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   Grandfather patients.   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with etanercept prior to 17 March 2005 or adalimumab and infliximab prior to 16 March 2006, may apply for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the relevant initial treatment restriction (Initial 3). These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with any biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment for all agents.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological agent, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. Patients are eligible to receive continuing biological treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   Patients must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   (3)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate biological agent without having to re-qualify with respect to either the indices of disease severity (i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and active joint count) or the prior non-biological therapy requirements.   Patients may swap to an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.   Patients may alternate between therapy with any biological agent of their choice (1 at a time) providing:  (i) they have not received PBS-subsidised treatment with that particular biological agent previously; or  (ii) they have demonstrated an adequate response to that particular biological agent if they have previously trialled it on the PBS.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the biological agent the patient is ceasing.   (4)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the indices of disease severity submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. 20 or more active joints), response will be determined according to a reduction in the total number of active joints.   (5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must re-qualify for initial treatment with respect to both the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with methotrexate or sulfasalazine or leflunomide, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR or CRP levels and the active joint counts are measured.	3094

9033K	Initial 2  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle and are eligible to receive further biological therapy; and  (3) have not failed treatment with adalimumab during the current Treatment Cycle.   Applications for patients who have demonstrated a response to PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment within this Treatment Cycle and who wish to re-commence adalimumab treatment within the same Cycle following a break in therapy, will only be approved where evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment has been submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of cessation of treatment.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised biological therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy. This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2945
9034L	Continuing treatment  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults:  (1) who have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised biological agent for this condition in the current Treatment Cycle was with adalimumab; and  (3) who, at the time of application, demonstrate an adequate response to treatment with adalimumab.   An adequate response to treatment with adalimumab is defined as:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline; AND either of the following:  (i) a reduction in the total active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline, where baseline is at least 20 active joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the number of the following major active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   All applications for continuing treatment with adalimumab must include a measurement of response to the prior course of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with adalimumab, it must be accompanied by an assessment of response to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with the initial treatment course.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2947

9035M	Initial 1  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle; and  (3) have failed to achieve an adequate response to:  (a) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly for a minimum period of 3 months; and  (b) sulfasalazine at a dose of at least 2 g per day for a minimum period of 3 months; or  (c) leflunomide at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for a minimum period of 3 months.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of acceptable toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au).   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form. Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) for adult patients with severe active psoriatic arthritis.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological agents at any 1 time.  Where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab.   From 1 August 2006, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare, when swapping to the alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   Following demonstration of response to initial treatment, these biological agents are available under the PBS for continuing treatment as set out in the continuing treatment restriction for each agent.   Once patients have either failed or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a single Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy before they are eligible to commence another Cycle [further details are under '(5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' below].   The 5-year break in therapy will be measured from the date the last approval for PBS-subsidised treatment was granted in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Cycle.   Within the same Cycle, patients are not allowed to fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once. Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for any biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent which they have not previously failed, if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe active psoriatic arthritis after 1 August 2006.   (1)  Initial treatment.   Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); and  (ii) patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; and  (iii) patients wish to re-commence treatment with a specific biological agent following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that specific agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment for non-grandfather patients will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for all agents except for infliximab, for which a maximum of 22 weeks will be authorised.  It is recommended that patients be reviewed in the month prior to completing their course of initial treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological agent supply.   Patients must be assessed for response to any course of PBS-subsidised initial treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   Grandfather patients.   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with etanercept prior to 17 March 2005 or adalimumab and infliximab prior to 16 March 2006, may apply for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the relevant initial treatment restriction (Initial 3). These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with any biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment for all agents.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological agent, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. Patients are eligible to receive continuing biological treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   Patients must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   (3)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate biological agent without having to re-qualify with respect to either the indices of disease severity (i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and active joint count) or the prior non-biological therapy requirements.   Patients may swap to an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.   Patients may alternate between therapy with any biological agent of their choice (1 at a time) providing:  (i) they have not received PBS-subsidised treatment with that particular biological agent previously; or  (ii) they have demonstrated an adequate response to that particular biological agent if they have previously trialled it on the PBS.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the biological agent the patient is ceasing.   (4)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the indices of disease severity submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. 20 or more active joints), response will be determined according to a reduction in the total number of active joints.   (5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must re-qualify for initial treatment with respect to both the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with methotrexate or sulfasalazine or leflunomide, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR or CRP levels and the active joint counts are measured.	3095
9035M	Initial 2  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle and are eligible to receive further biological therapy; and  (3) have not failed treatment with etanercept during the current Treatment Cycle.   Applications for patients who have demonstrated a response to PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment within this Treatment Cycle and who wish to re-commence etanercept treatment within the same Cycle following a break in therapy, will only be approved where evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment has been submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of cessation of treatment.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised biological therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy. This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2949

A PASI assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated. This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.

It is recommended that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab, for adult patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  Therefore, where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab.   From 1 March 2010, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis prior to 1 March 2010 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2010.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 biological agent at any 1 time.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once.  Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.  A patient who, prior to 1 March 2010, was authorised to receive PBS-subsidised initial treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis with the same agent twice, is exempt from this condition in respect of applications approved prior to 1 March 2010.   Patients must be assessed for response to each course of continuing treatment according to the criteria included in the relevant continuing treatment restriction.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological agent therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.  The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Treatment Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years duration has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis after 1 March 2010.   There are separate restrictions for both the initial and continuing treatment for psoriasis affecting the whole body, versus psoriasis affecting the face, hands and feet.   (1)  Application for approval for initial treatment.   Applications for a course of initial treatment should be made in the following situations:  (i)  patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii)  patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under '(4)  Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii)  patients who wish to re-commence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment in the case of adalimumab and etanercept, 22 weeks of treatment in the case of infliximab and 28 weeks of treatment in the case of ustekinumab.   Grandfather patients (adalimumab and ustekinumab only).   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 March 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 26 November 2009, may be made for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the initial treatment restriction (Initial 3).  These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with a biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Assessment of response to initial treatment.   When prescribing initial treatment with a biological agent, a PASI assessment must be conducted after at least 12 weeks of treatment.  This assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of the completion of this initial treatment course.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area as assessed at baseline.   (3)  Application for continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course of a biological agent to which an adequate response has been demonstrated, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that biological agent.  Patients are eligible to continue to receive continuous treatment with 24 week courses providing they continue to sustain a response.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to sustain a response to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   (4)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate agent within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to disease severity (i.e. a PASI score of greater than 15), or prior treatment requirements.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   Patients may trial an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.  However, they cannot swap to a particular agent if they have failed to respond to treatment with that particular agent within the same Cycle.   Patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 June 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 1 March 2010 access these interchangeability arrangements in the same way as patients who have not.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the agent being ceased.   (5)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated, based on the baseline PASI assessment submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and subsequent response will be assessed according to this revised PASI score.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same body area assessed at the baseline PASI assessment must be assessed for demonstration of response to treatment for the purposes of all continuing treatment applications.   (6)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent Biological Treatment Cycle, following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment according to the criteria of the relevant restriction and index of disease severity.  Patients must have had at least 1 prior treatment, as listed in the criteria, for a minimum of 6 weeks, and must have a PASI assessment conducted preferably whilst still on treatment, but no later than 1 month following cessation of treatment.  The PASI assessment must be no older than 1 month at the time of application.	3273

The application must include details of the NSAIDs trialled, their doses and duration of treatment.  If the NSAID dose is less than the maximum recommended dose in the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, the application must include the reason a higher dose cannot be used.   If treatment with NSAIDs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, the application must provide details of the contraindication.   If intolerance to NSAID treatment develops during the relevant period of use which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, the application must provide details of the nature and severity of this intolerance.  Details of the toxicities, including severity, which will be accepted for the purposes of administering this restriction can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   For details on the appropriate minimum exercise program that will be accepted for the purposes of administering this restriction, please refer to the Medicare Australia website at www.medicareaustralia.gov.au.   The following criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated at the time of the initial application:  (a) a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) of at least 4 on a 0-10 scale; AND  (b) an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 10 mg per L.   The BASDAI must be determined at the completion of the 3 month NSAID and exercise trial, but prior to ceasing NSAID treatment. The BASDAI must be no more than 1 month old at the time of initial application.   Both ESR and CRP measures should be provided with the initial treatment application and both must be no more than 1 month old. If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reason this criterion cannot be satisfied.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which must include the following:  (i) a copy of the radiological report confirming Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis; and  (ii) a completed BASDAI Assessment Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au]; and  (iii) a completed Exercise Program Self Certification Form included in the supporting information form; and  (iv) a signed patient acknowledgment form.  Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment with the TNF-alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab) for ankylosing spondylitis will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   The assessment of the patient's response to the initial course of treatment must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment and submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the response assessment is not submitted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be approved under this criterion.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab for adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Where the term 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonist' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab only.   A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 3 TNF-alfa antagonists at any 1 time.   From 1 March 2007, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to the alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment prior to 1 March 2007 is considered to be in their first cycle as of 1 March 2007.   Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist more than once.  A patient who, prior to 1 March 2007, was authorised to receive PBS-subsidised initial treatment for ankylosing spondylitis with the same agent twice, is exempt from this condition in respect of applications approved prior to 1 March 2007.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist under the new treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new treatment cycle.   There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   (1)  How to prescribe PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy after 1 March 2007.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) TNF-alfa antagonist therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for etanercept and adalimumab and 18 weeks of treatment for infliximab.   From 1 March 2007, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   (b) Continuing treatment.  Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing TNF-alfa antagonist treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted TNF-alfa antagonist supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   (2)  Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate TNF-alfa antagonist within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the BASDAI), or the prior NSAID therapy and exercise program requirements.   A patient may trial an alternate TNF-alfa antagonist at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a TNF-alfa antagonist at the time of the application.   However, they cannot swap to a particular TNF-alfa antagonist if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same treatment cycle.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate TNF-alfa antagonist should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the TNF-alfa antagonist the patient is ceasing.   (3)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the BASDAI, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a TNF-alfa antagonist.  However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   For a new patient, the BASDAI used to determine the baseline must be measured while the patient is receiving NSAID therapy and completing their exercise program.  However, this is not required for any subsequent BASDAI results for these patients, nor for patients who were 'grandfathered' on to TNF-alfa antagonist treatment.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response.   (4)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with at least 1 NSAID, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 consecutive months immediately prior to the time the BASDAI, ESR and/or CRP levels are measured.   (5)  Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab.   A patient who commenced treatment with adalimumab for active ankylosing spondylitis prior to 1 November 2006 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the initial 'grandfather' treatment restriction.   A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once.  A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be authorised under this criterion.   Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further applications for treatment with adalimumab will be assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.   Where pre-TNF-alfa antagonist treatment baselines cannot be provided, the following criteria must be met to demonstrate a response to treatment:  The BASDAI score must be either:  (i) no more than 20% greater than the score included in the initial application for PBS-subsidised treatment; or  (ii) no greater than 2.  AND  One of the following:  (a) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (b) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L.   'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle.  For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that apply to a new patient.  See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2507
9077R	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement for all patients)  Initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who, in this treatment cycle, has received prior PBS-subsidised treatment with either adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab for this condition and has not failed PBS-subsidised therapy with adalimumab.   To demonstrate a response to treatment the application must be accompanied by the results of the most recent course of TNF-alfa antagonist therapy within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction after 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.  Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction prior to 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following at least 4 weeks of treatment. These assessments must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date the course was ceased.   If the response assessment to the previous course of TNF-alfa antagonist treatment is not submitted as detailed above, the patient will be deemed to have failed therapy with that particular course of TNF-alfa antagonist.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes a completed BASDAI Assessment Form with certification by the prescriber and the patient that the patient did not have access to their baseline BASDAI at the time of their assessment.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be approved under this criterion.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2508

9078T	Continuing treatment for all patients  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who:  (a) has demonstrated a response to treatment with adalimumab; and  (b) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised therapy in this treatment cycle was with adalimumab.   Response is defined as an improvement from baseline of at least 2 of the BASDAI and 1 of the following:  (a) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (b) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L; or  (c) an ESR or CRP measurement reduced by at least 20% from baseline.   For a 'grandfather' patient who does not have baselines prior to commencing treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist, see Note 5 for a definition of response to treatment.   Where only 1 acute phase reactant measurement is supplied in the first application for PBS-subsidised treatment, that same marker must be measured and supplied in all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   The first application for continuing treatment following an initial treatment course must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with adalimumab.   Applications for continuing treatment must be made in writing and should be posted to Medicare Australia no less than 2 weeks prior to the completion of the current treatment course.   Written applications for authorisation must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes a completed BASDAI Assessment Form with certification by the prescriber and the patient that the patient did not have access to their baseline BASDAI at the time of their continuing treatment assessment.   All measurements provided must be no more than 1 month old at the time of application.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be authorised under this criterion.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2510
9078T	Initial ('grandfather' patients)  Initial PBS-subsidised course of adalimumab treatment, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who has radiographically (plain X-ray) confirmed Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis and who was receiving treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 November 2006; AND  (a) is receiving treatment with adalimumab at the time of application; AND  (b) has not received prior PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab or etanercept; AND  (c) whose current Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score is either:  (i) less than or equal to 5 on a 0-10 scale; OR  (ii) improved by at least 2 from baseline; AND  (d) who has:  (i) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (ii) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L; or  (iii) an ESR or CRP measurement reduced by at least 20% from pre-treatment baseline.   The BASDAI assessment and ESR and/or CRP measurements provided must be no more than 1 month old at the time of application.  Where only 1 acute phase reactant measurement is supplied in the first application for PBS-subsidised treatment, that same marker must be measured and supplied in all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes the following:  (i) a copy of the radiological report confirming Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis; and  (ii) a completed BASDAI Assessment Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au]; and  (iii) a signed patient acknowledgment form included in the supporting information form.  Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment with the TNF-alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab) for ankylosing spondylitis will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   The assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of therapy must be made within the 4 weeks prior to completion of the course in order to ensure continuity of treatment.   A patient ceasing treatment or swapping to an alternate agent and wishing to demonstrate a response to treatment, must be assessed no earlier than 12 weeks from the commencement of PBS-subsidised treatment.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   If the response assessment is not submitted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be authorised under this criterion.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone.   Patients may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once	2509

These assessments must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date the course was ceased.   If the response assessment to the previous course of TNF-alfa antagonist treatment is not submitted as detailed above, the patient will be deemed to have failed therapy with that particular course of TNF-alfa antagonist.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes a completed BASDAI Assessment Form with certification by the prescriber and the patient that the patient did not have access to their baseline BASDAI at the time of their assessment.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with etanercept will be approved under this criterion.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2505
9086F	Continuing treatment for all patients  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who:  (a) has demonstrated a response to treatment with etanercept; and  (b) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised therapy in this treatment cycle was with etanercept.   Response is defined as an improvement from baseline of at least 2 of the BASDAI and 1 of the following:  (a) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (b) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L; or  (c) an ESR or CRP measurement reduced by at least 20% from baseline.   For a 'grandfather' patient who does not have baselines prior to commencing treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist, see Note 5 for a definition of response to treatment.   Where only 1 acute phase reactant measurement is supplied in the first application for PBS-subsidised treatment, that same marker must be measured and supplied in all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction after 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.  Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction prior to 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following at least 4 weeks of treatment.   Applications for continuing treatment must be made in writing and should be posted to Medicare Australia no less than 2 weeks prior to the completion of the current treatment course.

9087G	Initial 1  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle; and  (3) have failed to achieve an adequate response to:  (a) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly for a minimum period of 3 months; and  (b) sulfasalazine at a dose of at least 2 g per day for a minimum period of 3 months; or  (c) leflunomide at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for a minimum period of 3 months.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of acceptable toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au).   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form. Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) for adult patients with severe active psoriatic arthritis.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological agents at any 1 time.  Where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab.   From 1 August 2006, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare, when swapping to the alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   Following demonstration of response to initial treatment, these biological agents are available under the PBS for continuing treatment as set out in the continuing treatment restriction for each agent.   Once patients have either failed or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a single Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy before they are eligible to commence another Cycle [further details are under '(5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' below].   The 5-year break in therapy will be measured from the date the last approval for PBS-subsidised treatment was granted in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Cycle.   Within the same Cycle, patients are not allowed to fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once. Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for any biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent which they have not previously failed, if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe active psoriatic arthritis after 1 August 2006.   (1)  Initial treatment.   Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); and  (ii) patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; and  (iii) patients wish to re-commence treatment with a specific biological agent following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that specific agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment for non-grandfather patients will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for all agents except for infliximab, for which a maximum of 22 weeks will be authorised.  It is recommended that patients be reviewed in the month prior to completing their course of initial treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological agent supply.   Patients must be assessed for response to any course of PBS-subsidised initial treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   Grandfather patients.   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with etanercept prior to 17 March 2005 or adalimumab and infliximab prior to 16 March 2006, may apply for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the relevant initial treatment restriction (Initial 3). These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with any biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment for all agents.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological agent, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. Patients are eligible to receive continuing biological treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   Patients must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   (3)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate biological agent without having to re-qualify with respect to either the indices of disease severity (i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and active joint count) or the prior non-biological therapy requirements.   Patients may swap to an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.   Patients may alternate between therapy with any biological agent of their choice (1 at a time) providing:  (i) they have not received PBS-subsidised treatment with that particular biological agent previously; or  (ii) they have demonstrated an adequate response to that particular biological agent if they have previously trialled it on the PBS.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the biological agent the patient is ceasing.   (4)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the indices of disease severity submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. 20 or more active joints), response will be determined according to a reduction in the total number of active joints.   (5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must re-qualify for initial treatment with respect to both the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with methotrexate or sulfasalazine or leflunomide, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR or CRP levels and the active joint counts are measured.	3095
9139B	Continuing treatment of stage III, IVa or IVb squamous cell cancer of the larynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx, in combination with radiotherapy, where cisplatin is either contraindicated or not tolerated\nNOTE: A maximum lifetime supply for this indication is limited to a maximum of 8 treatments per site and to 10 treatments per site for patients in whom radiotherapy is interrupted.	2715
9087G	Initial 2  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle and are eligible to receive further biological therapy; and  (3) have not failed treatment with etanercept during the current Treatment Cycle.   Applications for patients who have demonstrated a response to PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment within this Treatment Cycle and who wish to re-commence etanercept treatment within the same Cycle following a break in therapy, will only be approved where evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment has been submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of cessation of treatment.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised biological therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy. This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2949
9088H	Continuing treatment  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults:  (1) who have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised biological agent for this condition in the current Treatment Cycle was with etanercept; and  (3) who, at the time of application, demonstrate an adequate response to treatment with etanercept.   An adequate response to treatment with etanercept is defined as:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline; AND either of the following:  (i) a reduction in the total active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline, where baseline is at least 20 active joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the number of the following major active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   All applications for continuing treatment with etanercept must include a measurement of response to the prior course of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with etanercept, it must be accompanied by an assessment of response to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with the initial treatment course.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2951
9088H	Initial 3  Initial PBS-subsidised supply for continuing treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) were receiving treatment with etanercept prior to 17 March 2005; and  (3) have demonstrated a response as specified in the criteria for continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)]; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form. Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with etanercept will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Patients may qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this restriction once only	2950
9089J	Initial 1 (new patients)  Application for initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received no prior PBS-subsidised treatment with a bDMARD for this condition in this treatment cycle; and  (c) have failed to achieve an adequate response to the following treatments:  (i) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly; and  (ii) methotrexate (at a minimum dose of 7.5 mg weekly), in combination with 2 other non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for a minimum of 3 months; and  (iii) a minimum of 3 months' treatment with:   -  leflunomide; or   -  cyclosporin.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of the accepted toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L;  AND either  (i) a total active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a signed patient acknowledgement.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Assessment of a patient's response to an initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.  This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with etanercept.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial etanercept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Where the term bDMARD appears in the following notes and restrictions it refers to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab), the interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra) and the T-cell co-stimulation modulator (abatacept).   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs at any 1 time.   PBS-subsidised infliximab, anakinra, rituximab and abatacept must be used in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly. Where a patient cannot tolerate 7.5 mg of methotrexate weekly, they are only eligible to receive PBS-subsidised etanercept and adalimumab.   In order to be eligible to receive PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab, a patient must have already failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 course of treatment with a PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist.   From 1 March 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a Treatment Cycle where they may trial PBS-subsidised bDMARD agents without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Treatment Cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a bDMARD while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment prior to 1 March 2008 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2008.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised bDMARD more than once.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.   For patients who have failed PBS-subsidised treatment with 3 bDMARDs prior to 1 March 2008 please contact Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270.   The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a bDMARD under the new Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new Treatment Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   If patients fail to respond to a particular bDMARD within a single Treatment Cycle, they are not eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with that drug until they commence the next Cycle.   (1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy after 1 March 2008.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in this Treatment Cycle and wishes to commence such therapy, excluding rituximab (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) bDMARD therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific bDMARD following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for etanercept, adalimumab, anakinra and abatacept, 22 weeks of therapy for infliximab and 2 infusions of rituximab.   From 1 March 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment (excluding rituximab) following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients must be assessed following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 4 weeks.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised bDMARD (excluding rituximab) treatment it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Rituximab patients:  A further application may be submitted to Medicare Australia 24 weeks after the first infusion.  New baselines may be submitted with this application if appropriate.   (b) Continuing treatment.  Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific bDMARD (excluding rituximab), a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing bDMARD treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted bDMARD supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients:  A patient may qualify to receive a further course of treatment (every 24 weeks) with this agent providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion of their most recent treatment with rituximab. The patient remains eligible to receive a course of rituximab every 24 weeks providing they continue to demonstrate a response as specified in the restriction.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised bDMARD is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate bDMARD within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the joint count) or the prior non-bDMARD therapy requirements.  However the requirement for concomitant treatment with methotrexate, where it applies, must be met for each bDMARD trialled.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   A patient may trial an alternate bDMARD at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a bDMARD at the time of the application.  However, they cannot swap to a particular bDMARD if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same Treatment Cycle.   In order to trial rituximab, a patient must have trialled and failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   PBS subsidy does not allow for patients to receive treatment with another PBS-subsidised biological agent during the required treatment-free period applying to patients who have demonstrated a response to their most recent course of rituximab.  This means that patients who have demonstrated a response to a course of rituximab must have a PBS-subsidised biological therapy treatment-free period of at least 22 weeks, immediately following the second infusion, before swapping to an alternate bDMARD.  Patients who fail to respond to rituximab and who qualify and wish to trial a course of an alternate bDMARD may do so without having to have any treatment-free period.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate bDMARD should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the bDMARD the patient is ceasing.	3224
9089J	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement)  Application for an initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment for this condition in this treatment cycle and are eligible to receive further bDMARD therapy.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Applications for patients who have received PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept within this treatment cycle and who wish to re-commence therapy with this drug within this same cycle, must be accompanied by evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment, within the timeframes specified below.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial etanercept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle\nNOTE: (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the joint count, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a bDMARD.  However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. more than 20 active joints), response will be determined according to the reduction in the total number of active joints.  Where the baseline is determined on total number of major joints, the response must be demonstrated on the total number of major joints.   The baseline joint and blood counts should be performed whilst the patient is still on treatment or within 1 month of ceasing prior treatment.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent Treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with at least 1 non-biological DMARD, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR and/or CRP levels and the active joint count are measured.   (5)  Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab or abatacept.   From 1 March 2008, a patient who commenced treatment with rituximab for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 7 March 2007 or abatacept for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 1 November 2007 and who was 'grandfathered' on to PBS-subsidised therapy, and who continues to receive treatment in the same Treatment Cycle, will have further applications for treatment with rituximab or abatacept assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.   A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once.  A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with abatacept will be authorised under this criterion.   'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first Treatment Cycle.  For the second and subsequent Cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that applies to a new patient.  See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2845
9089J	Initial treatment, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of patients aged 18 years or older with a documented history of severe active polyarticular course juvenile chronic arthritis with onset prior to the age of 18 years; AND  (a) who have signed a patient agreement form indicating that they understand and acknowledge that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if the predetermined response criteria do not support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment; AND  (b) who have failed to achieve an adequate response to methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly; AND  (c) who have failed to achieve an adequate response to methotrexate, in combination with 2 other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for a minimum of 3 months; AND  (d) who have subsequently failed to achieve an adequate response following a minimum of 3 months' treatment with:  (i) leflunomide; or  (ii) cyclosporin.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, or intolerance of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal develops during the relevant period of use, the patient is exempted from demonstrating an inadequate response to the above treatment regimens. Details of the contraindication or intolerance, including the degree of toxicity, must be provided at the time of application.   The following criteria must be met in order to demonstrate failure to achieve an adequate response:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder, cervical spine and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).    If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be in writing and must include sufficient information to determine the patient's eligibility according to the above criteria.  The date of joint assessment must be provided.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial authority application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 4 months of treatment may be requested by telephone. Under no circumstances will telephone approvals be granted for initial or continuing authority applications, or for treatment that would otherwise extend the initial treatment period beyond 4 months.   The assessment of the patient's response to the initial course of treatment should be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated. Applications for continuing treatment with etanercept should be made prior to the completion of 16 weeks of treatment to ensure continuity for those patients who meet the criteria	3225

It is recommended that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab, for adult patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  Therefore, where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab.   From 1 March 2010, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis prior to 1 March 2010 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2010.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 biological agent at any 1 time.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once.  Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.  A patient who, prior to 1 March 2010, was authorised to receive PBS-subsidised initial treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis with the same agent twice, is exempt from this condition in respect of applications approved prior to 1 March 2010.   Patients must be assessed for response to each course of continuing treatment according to the criteria included in the relevant continuing treatment restriction.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological agent therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.  The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Treatment Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years duration has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis after 1 March 2010.   There are separate restrictions for both the initial and continuing treatment for psoriasis affecting the whole body, versus psoriasis affecting the face, hands and feet.   (1)  Application for approval for initial treatment.   Applications for a course of initial treatment should be made in the following situations:  (i)  patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii)  patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under '(4)  Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii)  patients who wish to re-commence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment in the case of adalimumab and etanercept, 22 weeks of treatment in the case of infliximab and 28 weeks of treatment in the case of ustekinumab.   Grandfather patients (adalimumab and ustekinumab only).   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 March 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 26 November 2009, may be made for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the initial treatment restriction (Initial 3).  These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with a biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Assessment of response to initial treatment.   When prescribing initial treatment with a biological agent, a PASI assessment must be conducted after at least 12 weeks of treatment.  This assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of the completion of this initial treatment course.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area as assessed at baseline.   (3)  Application for continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course of a biological agent to which an adequate response has been demonstrated, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that biological agent.  Patients are eligible to continue to receive continuous treatment with 24 week courses providing they continue to sustain a response.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to sustain a response to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   (4)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate agent within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to disease severity (i.e. a PASI score of greater than 15), or prior treatment requirements.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   Patients may trial an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.  However, they cannot swap to a particular agent if they have failed to respond to treatment with that particular agent within the same Cycle.   Patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 June 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 1 March 2010 access these interchangeability arrangements in the same way as patients who have not.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the agent being ceased.   (5)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated, based on the baseline PASI assessment submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and subsequent response will be assessed according to this revised PASI score.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same body area assessed at the baseline PASI assessment must be assessed for demonstration of response to treatment for the purposes of all continuing treatment applications.   (6)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent Biological Treatment Cycle, following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment according to the criteria of the relevant restriction and index of disease severity.  Patients must have had at least 1 prior treatment, as listed in the criteria, for a minimum of 6 weeks, and must have a PASI assessment conducted preferably whilst still on treatment, but no later than 1 month following cessation of treatment.  The PASI assessment must be no older than 1 month at the time of application.	3273

9099X	Initial 1 (new patients)  Application for initial PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received no prior PBS-subsidised treatment with a bDMARD for this condition in this treatment cycle; and  (c) have failed to achieve an adequate response to the following treatments:  (i) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly; and  (ii) methotrexate (at a minimum dose of 7.5 mg weekly), in combination with 2 other non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for a minimum of 3 months; and  (iii) a minimum of 3 months' treatment with:   -  leflunomide; or   -  cyclosporin.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of the accepted toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L;  AND either  (i) a total active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a signed patient acknowledgement.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Assessment of a patient's response to an initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.  This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with adalimumab.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial adalimumab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	3223
9099X	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement)  Application for an initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment for this condition in this treatment cycle and are eligible to receive further bDMARD therapy.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Applications for patients who have received PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab within this treatment cycle and who wish to re-commence therapy with this drug within this same cycle, must be accompanied by evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment, within the timeframes specified below.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial adalimumab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	2842

All applications for continuing treatment with adalimumab must include a measurement of response to the prior course of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with adalimumab, it must be accompanied by an assessment of response to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with an initial treatment course.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial adalimumab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	2843
9101B	Initial 1  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle; and  (3) have failed to achieve an adequate response to:  (a) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly for a minimum period of 3 months; and  (b) sulfasalazine at a dose of at least 2 g per day for a minimum period of 3 months; or  (c) leflunomide at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for a minimum period of 3 months.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of acceptable toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au).   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form. Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) for adult patients with severe active psoriatic arthritis.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological agents at any 1 time.  Where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab.   From 1 August 2006, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare, when swapping to the alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   Following demonstration of response to initial treatment, these biological agents are available under the PBS for continuing treatment as set out in the continuing treatment restriction for each agent.   Once patients have either failed or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a single Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy before they are eligible to commence another Cycle [further details are under '(5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' below].   The 5-year break in therapy will be measured from the date the last approval for PBS-subsidised treatment was granted in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Cycle.   Within the same Cycle, patients are not allowed to fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once. Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for any biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent which they have not previously failed, if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe active psoriatic arthritis after 1 August 2006.   (1)  Initial treatment.   Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); and  (ii) patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; and  (iii) patients wish to re-commence treatment with a specific biological agent following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that specific agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment for non-grandfather patients will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for all agents except for infliximab, for which a maximum of 22 weeks will be authorised.  It is recommended that patients be reviewed in the month prior to completing their course of initial treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological agent supply.   Patients must be assessed for response to any course of PBS-subsidised initial treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   Grandfather patients.   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with etanercept prior to 17 March 2005 or adalimumab and infliximab prior to 16 March 2006, may apply for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the relevant initial treatment restriction (Initial 3). These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with any biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment for all agents.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological agent, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. Patients are eligible to receive continuing biological treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   Patients must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   (3)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate biological agent without having to re-qualify with respect to either the indices of disease severity (i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and active joint count) or the prior non-biological therapy requirements.   Patients may swap to an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.   Patients may alternate between therapy with any biological agent of their choice (1 at a time) providing:  (i) they have not received PBS-subsidised treatment with that particular biological agent previously; or  (ii) they have demonstrated an adequate response to that particular biological agent if they have previously trialled it on the PBS.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the biological agent the patient is ceasing.   (4)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the indices of disease severity submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. 20 or more active joints), response will be determined according to a reduction in the total number of active joints.   (5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must re-qualify for initial treatment with respect to both the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with methotrexate or sulfasalazine or leflunomide, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR or CRP levels and the active joint counts are measured.	3094
9101B	Initial 2  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle and are eligible to receive further biological therapy; and  (3) have not failed treatment with adalimumab during the current Treatment Cycle.   Applications for patients who have demonstrated a response to PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment within this Treatment Cycle and who wish to re-commence adalimumab treatment within the same Cycle following a break in therapy, will only be approved where evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment has been submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of cessation of treatment.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised biological therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy. This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2945
9102C	Continuing treatment  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults:  (1) who have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised biological agent for this condition in the current Treatment Cycle was with adalimumab; and  (3) who, at the time of application, demonstrate an adequate response to treatment with adalimumab.   An adequate response to treatment with adalimumab is defined as:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline; AND either of the following:  (i) a reduction in the total active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline, where baseline is at least 20 active joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the number of the following major active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   All applications for continuing treatment with adalimumab must include a measurement of response to the prior course of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with adalimumab, it must be accompanied by an assessment of response to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with the initial treatment course.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2947
9102C	Initial 3  Initial PBS-subsidised supply for continuing treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) were receiving treatment with adalimumab prior to 16 March 2006; and  (3) have demonstrated a response as specified in the criteria for continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)]; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form. Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with adalimumab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Patients may qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this restriction once only	2946
9103D	Initial 1 (new patients)  First course of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with active ankylosing spondylitis who has radiographically (plain X-ray) confirmed Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis and who has not received any PBS-subsidised treatment with either adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab in this treatment cycle; AND  (a) who has at least 2 of the following:  (i) low back pain and stiffness for 3 or more months that is relieved by exercise but not by rest; or  (ii) limitation of motion of the lumbar spine in the sagittal and the frontal planes as determined by a score of at least 1 on each of the lumbar flexion and lumbar side flexion measurements of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) [for further information on the BASMI please refer to the Medicare Australia website at www.medicareaustralia.gov.au]; or  (iii) limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values for age and gender [for chest expansion normal values please refer to the Medicare Australia website at www.medicareaustralia.gov.au]; AND  (b) who has failed to achieve an adequate response following treatment with at least 2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), whilst completing an appropriate exercise program, for a total period of 3 months.   The application must include details of the NSAIDs trialled, their doses and duration of treatment.  If the NSAID dose is less than the maximum recommended dose in the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, the application must include the reason a higher dose cannot be used.   If treatment with NSAIDs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, the application must provide details of the contraindication.   If intolerance to NSAID treatment develops during the relevant period of use which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, the application must provide details of the nature and severity of this intolerance.  Details of the toxicities, including severity, which will be accepted for the purposes of administering this restriction can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   For details on the appropriate minimum exercise program that will be accepted for the purposes of administering this restriction, please refer to the Medicare Australia website at www.medicareaustralia.gov.au.   The following criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated at the time of the initial application:  (a) a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) of at least 4 on a 0-10 scale; AND  (b) an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 10 mg per L.   The BASDAI must be determined at the completion of the 3 month NSAID and exercise trial, but prior to ceasing NSAID treatment. The BASDAI must be no more than 1 month old at the time of initial application.   Both ESR and CRP measures should be provided with the initial treatment application and both must be no more than 1 month old. If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reason this criterion cannot be satisfied.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which must include the following:  (i) a copy of the radiological report confirming Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis; and  (ii) a completed BASDAI Assessment Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au]; and  (iii) a completed Exercise Program Self Certification Form included in the supporting information form; and  (iv) a signed patient acknowledgment form.  Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment with the TNF-alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab) for ankylosing spondylitis will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   The assessment of the patient's response to the initial course of treatment must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment and submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the response assessment is not submitted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be approved under this criterion.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab for adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Where the term 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonist' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab only.   A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 3 TNF-alfa antagonists at any 1 time.   From 1 March 2007, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to the alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment prior to 1 March 2007 is considered to be in their first cycle as of 1 March 2007.   Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist more than once.  A patient who, prior to 1 March 2007, was authorised to receive PBS-subsidised initial treatment for ankylosing spondylitis with the same agent twice, is exempt from this condition in respect of applications approved prior to 1 March 2007.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist under the new treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new treatment cycle.   There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   (1)  How to prescribe PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy after 1 March 2007.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) TNF-alfa antagonist therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for etanercept and adalimumab and 18 weeks of treatment for infliximab.   From 1 March 2007, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   (b) Continuing treatment.  Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing TNF-alfa antagonist treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted TNF-alfa antagonist supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   (2)  Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate TNF-alfa antagonist within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the BASDAI), or the prior NSAID therapy and exercise program requirements.   A patient may trial an alternate TNF-alfa antagonist at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a TNF-alfa antagonist at the time of the application.   However, they cannot swap to a particular TNF-alfa antagonist if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same treatment cycle.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate TNF-alfa antagonist should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the TNF-alfa antagonist the patient is ceasing.   (3)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the BASDAI, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a TNF-alfa antagonist.  However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   For a new patient, the BASDAI used to determine the baseline must be measured while the patient is receiving NSAID therapy and completing their exercise program.  However, this is not required for any subsequent BASDAI results for these patients, nor for patients who were 'grandfathered' on to TNF-alfa antagonist treatment.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response.   (4)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with at least 1 NSAID, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 consecutive months immediately prior to the time the BASDAI, ESR and/or CRP levels are measured.   (5)  Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab.   A patient who commenced treatment with adalimumab for active ankylosing spondylitis prior to 1 November 2006 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the initial 'grandfather' treatment restriction.   A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once.  A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be authorised under this criterion.   Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further applications for treatment with adalimumab will be assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.   Where pre-TNF-alfa antagonist treatment baselines cannot be provided, the following criteria must be met to demonstrate a response to treatment:  The BASDAI score must be either:  (i) no more than 20% greater than the score included in the initial application for PBS-subsidised treatment; or  (ii) no greater than 2.  AND  One of the following:  (a) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (b) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L.   'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle.  For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that apply to a new patient.  See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2507
9103D	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement for all patients)  Initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who, in this treatment cycle, has received prior PBS-subsidised treatment with either adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab for this condition and has not failed PBS-subsidised therapy with adalimumab.   To demonstrate a response to treatment the application must be accompanied by the results of the most recent course of TNF-alfa antagonist therapy within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction after 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.  Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction prior to 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following at least 4 weeks of treatment. These assessments must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date the course was ceased.   If the response assessment to the previous course of TNF-alfa antagonist treatment is not submitted as detailed above, the patient will be deemed to have failed therapy with that particular course of TNF-alfa antagonist.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes a completed BASDAI Assessment Form with certification by the prescriber and the patient that the patient did not have access to their baseline BASDAI at the time of their assessment.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be approved under this criterion.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2508
9104E	Continuing treatment for all patients  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who:  (a) has demonstrated a response to treatment with adalimumab; and  (b) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised therapy in this treatment cycle was with adalimumab.   Response is defined as an improvement from baseline of at least 2 of the BASDAI and 1 of the following:  (a) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (b) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L; or  (c) an ESR or CRP measurement reduced by at least 20% from baseline.   For a 'grandfather' patient who does not have baselines prior to commencing treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist, see Note 5 for a definition of response to treatment.   Where only 1 acute phase reactant measurement is supplied in the first application for PBS-subsidised treatment, that same marker must be measured and supplied in all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   The first application for continuing treatment following an initial treatment course must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with adalimumab.   Applications for continuing treatment must be made in writing and should be posted to Medicare Australia no less than 2 weeks prior to the completion of the current treatment course.   Written applications for authorisation must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes a completed BASDAI Assessment Form with certification by the prescriber and the patient that the patient did not have access to their baseline BASDAI at the time of their continuing treatment assessment.   All measurements provided must be no more than 1 month old at the time of application.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be authorised under this criterion.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2510
9104E	Initial ('grandfather' patients)  Initial PBS-subsidised course of adalimumab treatment, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who has radiographically (plain X-ray) confirmed Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis and who was receiving treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 November 2006; AND  (a) is receiving treatment with adalimumab at the time of application; AND  (b) has not received prior PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab or etanercept; AND  (c) whose current Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score is either:  (i) less than or equal to 5 on a 0-10 scale; OR  (ii) improved by at least 2 from baseline; AND  (d) who has:  (i) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (ii) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L; or  (iii) an ESR or CRP measurement reduced by at least 20% from pre-treatment baseline.   The BASDAI assessment and ESR and/or CRP measurements provided must be no more than 1 month old at the time of application.  Where only 1 acute phase reactant measurement is supplied in the first application for PBS-subsidised treatment, that same marker must be measured and supplied in all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes the following:  (i) a copy of the radiological report confirming Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis; and  (ii) a completed BASDAI Assessment Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au]; and  (iii) a signed patient acknowledgment form included in the supporting information form.  Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment with the TNF-alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab) for ankylosing spondylitis will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   The assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of therapy must be made within the 4 weeks prior to completion of the course in order to ensure continuity of treatment.   A patient ceasing treatment or swapping to an alternate agent and wishing to demonstrate a response to treatment, must be assessed no earlier than 12 weeks from the commencement of PBS-subsidised treatment.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   If the response assessment is not submitted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab will be authorised under this criterion.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone.   Patients may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once	2509

The cytogenetic or peripheral blood quantitative PCR analyses must be submitted as follows:  (i) between 10 and 18 months of the commencement of treatment with nilotinib, at which time patients in whom a major cytogenetic response or peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% has been demonstrated may receive authorisation for a further 12 months of treatment; and  (ii) at no greater than 12 month intervals thereafter, to demonstrate that the major cytogenetic response or peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% has been sustained.   For each authority application where eligibility for continuing PBS-subsidised treatment is to be demonstrated, a copy of the cytogenetic analysis indicating the number of Philadelphia positive [t (9;22)] cells in the bone marrow measured by standard karyotyping, or a copy of the quantitative PCR indicating the relative level of BCR-ABL transcript in the peripheral blood using the international scale, must be submitted as described in (i) and (ii) above. For bone marrow analyses, where the standard karyotyping conducted at the time of application is not informative, a copy of a cytogenetic analysis conducted on the bone marrow using FISH with BCR-ABL specific probe must be submitted with the authority application. A copy of the non-informative standard karyotype analysis must be included with the authority application.  Where a patient has previously received PBS-subsidised treatment with nilotinib, no approval will be granted for PBS-subsidised re-treatment where that patient has at any time failed to meet the criteria for continuing treatment.	3041

NOTE: Prescribers must be gastroenterologists (code 87), consultant physicians [internal medicine specialising in gastroenterology (code 81)] or consultant physicians [general medicine specialising in gastroenterology (code 82)].   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application. Details of the accepted toxicities including severity can be found on the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au).   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the application:  (a) have severity of disease activity which results in a Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score greater than or equal to 220;  AND/OR  (b) have evidence of active intestinal inflammation, including:  (i) blood: higher than normal platelet count, or, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour, or, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND/OR  (ii) faeces: higher than normal lactoferrin or calprotectin level; AND/OR  (iii) diagnostic imaging: demonstration of increased uptake of intravenous contrast with thickening of the bowel wall or mesenteric lymphadenopathy or fat streaking in the mesentery;  AND/OR  (c) be assessed clinically as being in a high faecal output state;  AND/OR  (d) be assessed clinically as requiring surgery or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as the next therapeutic option, in the absence of adalimumab.   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   Any one of the baseline criteria may be used to determine response to an initial course of treatment and eligibility for continued therapy, according to the criteria included in the continuing treatment restriction. However, the same criterion must be used for any subsequent determination of response to treatment, for the purpose of eligibility for continuing PBS-subsidised therapy.   Applications for authorisation must be made in writing and must include:  (a) two completed authority prescription forms; and  (b) a completed Crohn Disease PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes the following:  (i) details of prior systemic drug therapy [dosage, date of commencement and duration of therapy]; and  (ii) (1) reports and dates of the pathology or diagnostic imaging test(s) nominated as the response criterion, if relevant; or  (2) the completed current Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) calculation sheet including the dates of assessment of the patient's condition, if relevant; and  (iii) date of the most recent clinical assessment; and  (iv) the signed patient acknowledgement.   All assessments, pathology tests and diagnostic imaging studies must be made within 1 month of the date of application.   A maximum of 16 weeks treatment of adalimumab will be authorised under his criterion.   Two completed authority prescriptions must be submitted with every initial application for adalimumab.  One prescription must be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats.  The second prescription must be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats.  Where fewer than 2 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday). Under no circumstances will telephone approvals be granted for initial authority applications, or for treatment that would otherwise extend the initial treatment period.   The assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of treatment must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy after the first dose so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.   This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment. Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with adalimumab.

It is recommended that an application for continuing treatment is posted to Medicare Australia at the time of the 12 week assessment, to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE REFRACTORY CROHN DISEASE   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab and infliximab for adult patients with severe refractory Crohn disease. Where the term 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonist' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab and infliximab only.   A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 2 TNF-alfa antagonists at any 1 time.   From 1 August 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to the alternate agent. Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment prior to 1 August 2008 is considered to be in their first cycle as of 1 August 2008.   Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist more than twice.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist under the new treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new treatment cycle.   There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   (1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy after 1 August 2008.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) TNF-alfa antagonist therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and 14 weeks of therapy for infliximab.   From 1 August 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Adalimumab only:  Two completed authority prescriptions must be submitted with every initial application for adalimumab.  One prescription must be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats.  The second prescription must be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats.   (b) Continuing treatment. Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing TNF-alfa antagonist treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted TNF-alfa antagonist supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist is approved, a patient may swap if eligible to the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score, evidence of intestinal inflammation), or the prior corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy.   A patient may trial the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a TNF-alfa antagonist at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular TNF-alfa antagonist if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug two times within the same treatment cycle.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the TNF-alfa antagonist the patient is ceasing.   (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the CDAI or evidence of intestinal inflammation submitted with the first authority application for a TNF-alfa antagonist. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity. Patients must have received treatment with a corticosteroid and at least 1 immunosuppressive agent, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 consecutive months immediately prior to the time the CDAI score or the indices of intestinal inflammation are measured.    (5) Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab or infliximab.    A patient who commenced treatment with adalimumab for severe refractory Crohn disease prior to 9 November 2007 or infliximab prior to 7 March 2007 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the initial 'grandfather' treatment restriction.    A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once. A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab or infliximab will be authorised under this criterion.    Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further applications for treatment with adalimumab or infliximab will be assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.    'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle. For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that apply to a new patient. See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2986

NOTE: Prescribers must be gastroenterologists (code 87), consultant physicians [internal medicine specialising in gastroenterology (code 81)] or consultant physicians [general medicine specialising in gastroenterology (code 82)].   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application. Details of the accepted toxicities including severity can be found on the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au).   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the application:  (a) have severity of disease activity which results in a Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score greater than or equal to 220;  AND/OR  (b) have evidence of active intestinal inflammation, including:  (i) blood: higher than normal platelet count, or, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour, or, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND/OR  (ii) faeces: higher than normal lactoferrin or calprotectin level; AND/OR  (iii) diagnostic imaging: demonstration of increased uptake of intravenous contrast with thickening of the bowel wall or mesenteric lymphadenopathy or fat streaking in the mesentery;  AND/OR  (c) be assessed clinically as being in a high faecal output state;  AND/OR  (d) be assessed clinically as requiring surgery or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as the next therapeutic option, in the absence of adalimumab.   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   Any one of the baseline criteria may be used to determine response to an initial course of treatment and eligibility for continued therapy, according to the criteria included in the continuing treatment restriction. However, the same criterion must be used for any subsequent determination of response to treatment, for the purpose of eligibility for continuing PBS-subsidised therapy.   Applications for authorisation must be made in writing and must include:  (a) two completed authority prescription forms; and  (b) a completed Crohn Disease PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes the following:  (i) details of prior systemic drug therapy [dosage, date of commencement and duration of therapy]; and  (ii) (1) reports and dates of the pathology or diagnostic imaging test(s) nominated as the response criterion, if relevant; or  (2) the completed current Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) calculation sheet including the dates of assessment of the patient's condition, if relevant; and  (iii) date of the most recent clinical assessment; and  (iv) the signed patient acknowledgement.   All assessments, pathology tests and diagnostic imaging studies must be made within 1 month of the date of application.   A maximum of 16 weeks treatment of adalimumab will be authorised under his criterion.   Two completed authority prescriptions must be submitted with every initial application for adalimumab.  One prescription must be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats.  The second prescription must be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats.  Where fewer than 2 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday). Under no circumstances will telephone approvals be granted for initial authority applications, or for treatment that would otherwise extend the initial treatment period.   The assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of treatment must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy after the first dose so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.   This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment. Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with adalimumab.   It is recommended that an application for continuing treatment is posted to Medicare Australia at the time of the 12 week assessment, to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment	2993

A CDAI assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of treatment must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks therapy so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.   This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment. Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with adalimumab.   It is recommended that an application for continuing treatment is posted to Medicare Australia at the time of the 12 week assessment, to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE REFRACTORY CROHN DISEASE   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab and infliximab for adult patients with severe refractory Crohn disease. Where the term 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonist' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab and infliximab only.   A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 2 TNF-alfa antagonists at any 1 time.   From 1 August 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to the alternate agent. Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment prior to 1 August 2008 is considered to be in their first cycle as of 1 August 2008.   Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist more than twice.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist under the new treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new treatment cycle.   There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   (1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy after 1 August 2008.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) TNF-alfa antagonist therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and 14 weeks of therapy for infliximab.   From 1 August 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Adalimumab only:  Two completed authority prescriptions must be submitted with every initial application for adalimumab.  One prescription must be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats.  The second prescription must be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats.   (b) Continuing treatment. Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing TNF-alfa antagonist treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted TNF-alfa antagonist supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist is approved, a patient may swap if eligible to the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score, evidence of intestinal inflammation), or the prior corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy.   A patient may trial the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a TNF-alfa antagonist at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular TNF-alfa antagonist if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug two times within the same treatment cycle.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the TNF-alfa antagonist the patient is ceasing.   (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the CDAI or evidence of intestinal inflammation submitted with the first authority application for a TNF-alfa antagonist. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity. Patients must have received treatment with a corticosteroid and at least 1 immunosuppressive agent, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 consecutive months immediately prior to the time the CDAI score or the indices of intestinal inflammation are measured.    (5) Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab or infliximab.    A patient who commenced treatment with adalimumab for severe refractory Crohn disease prior to 9 November 2007 or infliximab prior to 7 March 2007 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the initial 'grandfather' treatment restriction.    A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once. A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab or infliximab will be authorised under this criterion.    Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further applications for treatment with adalimumab or infliximab will be assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.    'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle. For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that apply to a new patient. See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2986
9187M	Initial 2  Change or re-commencement of treatment of Crohn disease in a patient assessed by CDAI.   Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab by a gastroenterologist or a consultant physician as specified in the NOTE below of a patient who:  (a) has a documented history of severe refractory Crohn disease; and  (b) in this treatment cycle, has received prior PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab or adalimumab for this condition; and  (c) has not failed PBS-subsidised therapy with adalimumab for this condition more than once in the current treatment cycle.   NOTE: Prescribers must be gastroenterologists (code 87), consultant physicians [internal medicine specialising in gastroenterology (code 81)] or consultant physicians [general medicine specialising in gastroenterology (code 82)].   To demonstrate a response to treatment the application must be accompanied by the results of the most recent course of TNF-alfa antagonist therapy within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   If the response assessment to the previous course of TNF-alfa antagonist treatment is not submitted as detailed above, the patient will be deemed to have failed therapy with that particular course of TNF-alfa antagonist.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) two completed authority prescription forms; and  (b) a completed Crohn Disease PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes the following:  (i) the completed current Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score calculation sheet including the date of the assessment of the patient's condition; and  (ii) details of prior TNF alfa antagonist treatment including details of date and duration of treatment.

The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the application:  (a) have severity of disease activity which results in a Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score greater than or equal to 220;  AND/OR  (b) have evidence of active intestinal inflammation, including:  (i) blood: higher than normal platelet count, or, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour, or, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND/OR  (ii) faeces: higher than normal lactoferrin or calprotectin level; AND/OR  (iii) diagnostic imaging: demonstration of increased uptake of intravenous contrast with thickening of the bowel wall or mesenteric lymphadenopathy or fat streaking in the mesentery;  AND/OR  (c) be assessed clinically as being in a high faecal output state;  AND/OR  (d) be assessed clinically as requiring surgery or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as the next therapeutic option, in the absence of adalimumab.   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   Any one of the baseline criteria may be used to determine response to an initial course of treatment and eligibility for continued therapy, according to the criteria included in the continuing treatment restriction. However, the same criterion must be used for any subsequent determination of response to treatment, for the purpose of eligibility for continuing PBS-subsidised therapy.   Applications for authorisation must be made in writing and must include:  (a) two completed authority prescription forms; and  (b) a completed Crohn Disease PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes the following:  (i) details of prior systemic drug therapy [dosage, date of commencement and duration of therapy]; and  (ii) (1) reports and dates of the pathology or diagnostic imaging test(s) nominated as the response criterion, if relevant; or  (2) the completed current Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) calculation sheet including the dates of assessment of the patient's condition, if relevant; and  (iii) date of the most recent clinical assessment; and  (iv) the signed patient acknowledgement.   All assessments, pathology tests and diagnostic imaging studies must be made within 1 month of the date of application.   A maximum of 16 weeks treatment of adalimumab will be authorised under his criterion.   Two completed authority prescriptions must be submitted with every initial application for adalimumab.  One prescription must be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats.  The second prescription must be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats.  Where fewer than 2 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday). Under no circumstances will telephone approvals be granted for initial authority applications, or for treatment that would otherwise extend the initial treatment period.   The assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of treatment must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy after the first dose so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.   This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment. Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with adalimumab.   It is recommended that an application for continuing treatment is posted to Medicare Australia at the time of the 12 week assessment, to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment	2993

Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with adalimumab.   It is recommended that an application for continuing treatment is posted to Medicare Australia at the time of the 12 week assessment, to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE REFRACTORY CROHN DISEASE   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab and infliximab for adult patients with severe refractory Crohn disease. Where the term 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonist' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab and infliximab only.   A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 2 TNF-alfa antagonists at any 1 time.   From 1 August 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to the alternate agent. Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment prior to 1 August 2008 is considered to be in their first cycle as of 1 August 2008.   Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist more than twice.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist under the new treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new treatment cycle.   There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   (1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy after 1 August 2008.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) TNF-alfa antagonist therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and 14 weeks of therapy for infliximab.   From 1 August 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Adalimumab only:  Two completed authority prescriptions must be submitted with every initial application for adalimumab.  One prescription must be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats.  The second prescription must be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats.   (b) Continuing treatment. Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing TNF-alfa antagonist treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted TNF-alfa antagonist supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist is approved, a patient may swap if eligible to the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score, evidence of intestinal inflammation), or the prior corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy.   A patient may trial the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a TNF-alfa antagonist at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular TNF-alfa antagonist if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug two times within the same treatment cycle.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the TNF-alfa antagonist the patient is ceasing.   (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the CDAI or evidence of intestinal inflammation submitted with the first authority application for a TNF-alfa antagonist. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity. Patients must have received treatment with a corticosteroid and at least 1 immunosuppressive agent, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 consecutive months immediately prior to the time the CDAI score or the indices of intestinal inflammation are measured.    (5) Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab or infliximab.    A patient who commenced treatment with adalimumab for severe refractory Crohn disease prior to 9 November 2007 or infliximab prior to 7 March 2007 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the initial 'grandfather' treatment restriction.    A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once. A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab or infliximab will be authorised under this criterion.    Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further applications for treatment with adalimumab or infliximab will be assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.    'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle. For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that apply to a new patient. See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2986

It is recommended that an application for continuing treatment is posted to Medicare Australia at the time of the 12 week assessment, to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE REFRACTORY CROHN DISEASE   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab and infliximab for adult patients with severe refractory Crohn disease. Where the term 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonist' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab and infliximab only.   A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 2 TNF-alfa antagonists at any 1 time.   From 1 August 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to the alternate agent. Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment prior to 1 August 2008 is considered to be in their first cycle as of 1 August 2008.   Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist more than twice.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist under the new treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of TNF-alfa antagonists in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new treatment cycle.   There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   (1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy after 1 August 2008.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) TNF-alfa antagonist therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and 14 weeks of therapy for infliximab.   From 1 August 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Adalimumab only:  Two completed authority prescriptions must be submitted with every initial application for adalimumab.  One prescription must be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats.  The second prescription must be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats.   (b) Continuing treatment. Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific TNF-alfa antagonist, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing TNF-alfa antagonist treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted TNF-alfa antagonist supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that TNF-alfa antagonist.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist is approved, a patient may swap if eligible to the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score, evidence of intestinal inflammation), or the prior corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy.   A patient may trial the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a TNF-alfa antagonist at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular TNF-alfa antagonist if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug two times within the same treatment cycle.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to the alternate TNF-alfa antagonist should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the TNF-alfa antagonist the patient is ceasing.   (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the CDAI or evidence of intestinal inflammation submitted with the first authority application for a TNF-alfa antagonist. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity. Patients must have received treatment with a corticosteroid and at least 1 immunosuppressive agent, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 consecutive months immediately prior to the time the CDAI score or the indices of intestinal inflammation are measured.    (5) Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab or infliximab.    A patient who commenced treatment with adalimumab for severe refractory Crohn disease prior to 9 November 2007 or infliximab prior to 7 March 2007 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the initial 'grandfather' treatment restriction.    A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once. A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab or infliximab will be authorised under this criterion.    Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further applications for treatment with adalimumab or infliximab will be assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.    'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle. For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that apply to a new patient. See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2986
9190Q	Initial 2  Change or re-commencement of treatment of Crohn disease in a patient assessed by CDAI.   Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab by a gastroenterologist or a consultant physician as specified in the NOTE below of a patient who:  (a) has a documented history of severe refractory Crohn disease; and  (b) in this treatment cycle, has received prior PBS-subsidised treatment with infliximab or adalimumab for this condition; and  (c) has not failed PBS-subsidised therapy with adalimumab for this condition more than once in the current treatment cycle.   NOTE: Prescribers must be gastroenterologists (code 87), consultant physicians [internal medicine specialising in gastroenterology (code 81)] or consultant physicians [general medicine specialising in gastroenterology (code 82)].   To demonstrate a response to treatment the application must be accompanied by the results of the most recent course of TNF-alfa antagonist therapy within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.

9282M	Initial treatment, as the sole PBS-subsidised therapy, of a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia in any disease phase bearing the Philadelphia chromosome or expressing the transcript, BCR-ABL, who has active leukaemia (as defined by presence on current pathology assessments of either the Philadelphia chromosome on cytogenetic or FISH analysis, or the presence of the transcript BCR-ABL greater than 1% on the international scale) and who has failed an adequate trial of imatinib.   Failure of an adequate trial of imatinib is defined as:   (i) Lack of response to initial imatinib therapy, defined as either:   -  failure to achieve a haematological response after a minimum of 3 months therapy with imatinib for patients initially treated in chronic phase; or   -  failure to achieve any cytogenetic response after a minimum of 6 months therapy with imatinib for patients initially treated in chronic phase as demonstrated on bone marrow biopsy by presence of greater than 95% Philadelphia chromosome positive cells; or   -  failure to achieve a major cytogenetic response or a peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% after a minimum of 12 months therapy with imatinib; OR   (ii) Loss of a previously documented major cytogenetic response (demonstrated by the presence of greater than 35% Ph positive cells on bone marrow biopsy), during ongoing imatinib therapy; OR   (iii) Loss of a previously demonstrated molecular response (demonstrated by peripheral blood BCR-ABL levels increasing in value by at least 5 fold to a level of greater than 1% confirmed on a subsequent test), during ongoing imatinib therapy; OR   (iv) Development of accelerated phase or blast crisis in a patient previously prescribed imatinib for any phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia.   Accelerated phase is defined by the presence of 1 or more of the following:  (1) Percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow greater than or equal to 15% but less than 30%; or  (2) Percentage of blasts plus promyelocytes in the peripheral blood or bone marrow greater than or equal to 30%; or  (3) Peripheral basophils greater than or equal to 20%; or  (4) Progressive splenomegaly to a size greater than or equal to 10 cm below the left costal margin to be confirmed on 2 occasions at least 4 weeks apart, or a greater than or equal to 50% increase in size below the left costal margin over 4 weeks; or  (5) Karyotypic evolution (chromosomal abnormalities in addition to a single Philadelphia chromosome).   Blast crisis is defined as either:  (1) Percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow greater than or equal to 30%; or  (2) Extramedullary involvement other than spleen and liver; OR   (v) Disease progression (defined as a greater than or equal to 50% increase in peripheral white blood cell count, blast count, basophils or platelets) during first-line imatinib therapy in patients with accelerated phase or blast crisis chronic myeloid leukaemia; OR   (vi) Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicity that is imatinib related and necessitates permanent cessation of imatinib. For patients with imatinib related toxicities, leukaemia activity does not need to be demonstrated.   Applications for authorisation must be in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia Dasatinib/Nilotinib PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form; and  (c) a signed patient acknowledgement; and  (d) a bone marrow biopsy pathology report demonstrating the patient has active chronic myeloid leukaemia, either manifest as cytogenetic evidence of the Philadelphia chromosome, or RT-PCR level of BCR-ABL transcript greater than 1% on the international scale. (The date of the relevant pathology report needs to be provided); and  (e) where there has been a loss of response to imatinib, a copy of the current confirming pathology report(s) from an Approved Pathology Authority or details of the dates of assessment in the case of progressive splenomegaly or extramedullary involvement; or  (f) details of Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicity\nNOTE: Dasatinib will only be subsidised for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who are not receiving concomitant PBS-subsidised imatinib mesylate, nilotinib or interferon alfa therapy.   Patients should be commenced on a dose of dasatinib of at least 100 mg (base) daily. Continuing therapy is dependent on patients demonstrating a major cytogenetic response to dasatinib therapy or a peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% at 18 months and thereafter at 12 monthly intervals, irrespective of the daily dasatinib dose received.   From 1 November 2008, under the PBS, a patient will be able to trial either dasatinib and/or nilotinib within the initial 18 month treatment period, providing the patient's CML is not resistant to the first second-line agent.   Dasatinib is not PBS-subsidised for patients with CML that is resistant to nilotinib.	3078

For the purposes of assessing response to PBS-subsidised treatment with dasatinib, either cytogenetic analysis indicating the number of Philadelphia positive [t (9;22)] cells in the bone marrow measured by standard karyotyping, or quantitative PCR indicating the relative level of BCR-ABL transcript in the peripheral blood using the international scale, must be submitted. For bone marrow analyses, where the standard karyotyping is not informative for technical reasons, a cytogenetic analysis performed on the bone marrow by the use of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with BCR-ABL specific probe must be submitted. The cytogenetic or peripheral blood quantitative PCR analyses must be submitted as follows:  (i) between 10 and 18 months of the commencement of treatment with dasatinib, at which time patients in whom a major cytogenetic response or peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% has been demonstrated may receive authorisation for a further 12 months of treatment; and  (ii) at no greater than 12 month intervals thereafter, to demonstrate that the major cytogenetic response or peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% has been sustained.  For each authority application where eligibility for continuing PBS-subsidised treatment is to be demonstrated, a copy of the cytogenetic analysis indicating the number of Philadelphia positive [t (9;22)] cells in the bone marrow measured by standard karyotyping, or a copy of the quantitative PCR indicating the relative level of BCR-ABL transcript in the peripheral blood using the international scale, must be submitted as described in (i) and (ii) above. For bone marrow analyses, where the standard karyotyping conducted at the time of application is not informative, a copy of a cytogenetic analysis conducted on the bone marrow using FISH with BCR-ABL specific probe must be submitted with the authority application. A copy of the non-informative standard karyotype analysis must be included with the authority application.  Where a patient has previously received PBS-subsidised treatment with dasatinib, no approval will be granted for PBS-subsidised re-treatment where that patient has at any time failed to meet the criteria for continuing treatment.	3039

A PASI assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated. This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.

It is recommended that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab, for adult patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  Therefore, where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab.   From 1 March 2010, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis prior to 1 March 2010 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2010.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 biological agent at any 1 time.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once.  Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.  A patient who, prior to 1 March 2010, was authorised to receive PBS-subsidised initial treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis with the same agent twice, is exempt from this condition in respect of applications approved prior to 1 March 2010.   Patients must be assessed for response to each course of continuing treatment according to the criteria included in the relevant continuing treatment restriction.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological agent therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.  The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Treatment Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years duration has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis after 1 March 2010.   There are separate restrictions for both the initial and continuing treatment for psoriasis affecting the whole body, versus psoriasis affecting the face, hands and feet.   (1)  Application for approval for initial treatment.   Applications for a course of initial treatment should be made in the following situations:  (i)  patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii)  patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under '(4)  Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii)  patients who wish to re-commence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment in the case of adalimumab and etanercept, 22 weeks of treatment in the case of infliximab and 28 weeks of treatment in the case of ustekinumab.   Grandfather patients (adalimumab and ustekinumab only).   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 March 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 26 November 2009, may be made for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the initial treatment restriction (Initial 3).  These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with a biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Assessment of response to initial treatment.   When prescribing initial treatment with a biological agent, a PASI assessment must be conducted after at least 12 weeks of treatment.  This assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of the completion of this initial treatment course.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area as assessed at baseline.   (3)  Application for continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course of a biological agent to which an adequate response has been demonstrated, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that biological agent.  Patients are eligible to continue to receive continuous treatment with 24 week courses providing they continue to sustain a response.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to sustain a response to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   (4)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate agent within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to disease severity (i.e. a PASI score of greater than 15), or prior treatment requirements.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   Patients may trial an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.  However, they cannot swap to a particular agent if they have failed to respond to treatment with that particular agent within the same Cycle.   Patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 June 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 1 March 2010 access these interchangeability arrangements in the same way as patients who have not.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the agent being ceased.   (5)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated, based on the baseline PASI assessment submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and subsequent response will be assessed according to this revised PASI score.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same body area assessed at the baseline PASI assessment must be assessed for demonstration of response to treatment for the purposes of all continuing treatment applications.   (6)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent Biological Treatment Cycle, following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment according to the criteria of the relevant restriction and index of disease severity.  Patients must have had at least 1 prior treatment, as listed in the criteria, for a minimum of 6 weeks, and must have a PASI assessment conducted preferably whilst still on treatment, but no later than 1 month following cessation of treatment.  The PASI assessment must be no older than 1 month at the time of application.	3265

It is recommended that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised adalimumab treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab, for adult patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  Therefore, where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab.   From 1 March 2010, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis prior to 1 March 2010 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2010.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 biological agent at any 1 time.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once.  Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.  A patient who, prior to 1 March 2010, was authorised to receive PBS-subsidised initial treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis with the same agent twice, is exempt from this condition in respect of applications approved prior to 1 March 2010.   Patients must be assessed for response to each course of continuing treatment according to the criteria included in the relevant continuing treatment restriction.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological agent therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.  The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Treatment Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years duration has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis after 1 March 2010.   There are separate restrictions for both the initial and continuing treatment for psoriasis affecting the whole body, versus psoriasis affecting the face, hands and feet.   (1)  Application for approval for initial treatment.   Applications for a course of initial treatment should be made in the following situations:  (i)  patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii)  patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under '(4)  Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii)  patients who wish to re-commence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment in the case of adalimumab and etanercept, 22 weeks of treatment in the case of infliximab and 28 weeks of treatment in the case of ustekinumab.   Grandfather patients (adalimumab and ustekinumab only).   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 March 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 26 November 2009, may be made for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the initial treatment restriction (Initial 3).  These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with a biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Assessment of response to initial treatment.   When prescribing initial treatment with a biological agent, a PASI assessment must be conducted after at least 12 weeks of treatment.  This assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of the completion of this initial treatment course.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area as assessed at baseline.   (3)  Application for continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course of a biological agent to which an adequate response has been demonstrated, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that biological agent.  Patients are eligible to continue to receive continuous treatment with 24 week courses providing they continue to sustain a response.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to sustain a response to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   (4)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate agent within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to disease severity (i.e. a PASI score of greater than 15), or prior treatment requirements.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   Patients may trial an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.  However, they cannot swap to a particular agent if they have failed to respond to treatment with that particular agent within the same Cycle.   Patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 June 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 1 March 2010 access these interchangeability arrangements in the same way as patients who have not.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the agent being ceased.   (5)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated, based on the baseline PASI assessment submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and subsequent response will be assessed according to this revised PASI score.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same body area assessed at the baseline PASI assessment must be assessed for demonstration of response to treatment for the purposes of all continuing treatment applications.   (6)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent Biological Treatment Cycle, following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment according to the criteria of the relevant restriction and index of disease severity.  Patients must have had at least 1 prior treatment, as listed in the criteria, for a minimum of 6 weeks, and must have a PASI assessment conducted preferably whilst still on treatment, but no later than 1 month following cessation of treatment.  The PASI assessment must be no older than 1 month at the time of application.	3265

If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reason this criterion cannot be satisfied.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which must include the following:  (i) a copy of the radiological report confirming Grade II bilateral sacroiliitis or Grade III unilateral sacroiliitis; and  (ii) a completed BASDAI Assessment Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au]; and  (iii) a completed Exercise Program Self Certification Form included in the supporting information form; and  (iv) a signed patient acknowledgment form.  Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment with the TNF-alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab) for ankylosing spondylitis will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   The assessment of the patient's response to the initial course of treatment must be made following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment and submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the response assessment is not submitted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with etanercept will be approved under this criterion.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2504
9455P	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement for all patients)  Initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who, in this treatment cycle, has received prior PBS-subsidised treatment with either adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab for this condition and has not failed PBS-subsidised therapy with etanercept.   To demonstrate a response to treatment the application must be accompanied by the results of the most recent course of TNF-alfa antagonist therapy within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction after 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.  Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction prior to 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following at least 4 weeks of treatment. These assessments must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date the course was ceased.   If the response assessment to the previous course of TNF-alfa antagonist treatment is not submitted as detailed above, the patient will be deemed to have failed therapy with that particular course of TNF-alfa antagonist.   Authority applications must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes a completed BASDAI Assessment Form with certification by the prescriber and the patient that the patient did not have access to their baseline BASDAI at the time of their assessment.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment with etanercept will be approved under this criterion.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2505
9456Q	Continuing treatment for all patients  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment, by a rheumatologist, of an adult with a documented history of active ankylosing spondylitis who:  (a) has demonstrated a response to treatment with etanercept; and  (b) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised therapy in this treatment cycle was with etanercept.   Response is defined as an improvement from baseline of at least 2 of the BASDAI and 1 of the following:  (a) an ESR measurement no greater than 25 mm per hour; or  (b) a CRP measurement no greater than 10 mg per L; or  (c) an ESR or CRP measurement reduced by at least 20% from baseline.   For a 'grandfather' patient who does not have baselines prior to commencing treatment with a TNF-alfa antagonist, see Note 5 for a definition of response to treatment.   Where only 1 acute phase reactant measurement is supplied in the first application for PBS-subsidised treatment, that same marker must be measured and supplied in all subsequent continuing treatment applications.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction after 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.  Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment was approved under an initial treatment restriction prior to 1 March 2007, the patient must have been assessed for response to that course following at least 4 weeks of treatment.   Applications for continuing treatment must be made in writing and should be posted to Medicare Australia no less than 2 weeks prior to the completion of the current treatment course.   Written applications for authorisation must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Ankylosing Spondylitis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au] which includes a completed BASDAI Assessment Form with certification by the prescriber and the patient that the patient did not have access to their baseline BASDAI at the time of their continuing treatment assessment.   All measurements provided must be no more than 1 month old at the time of application.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with etanercept will be authorised under this criterion.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone	2506
9457R	Initial 1  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle; and  (3) have failed to achieve an adequate response to:  (a) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly for a minimum period of 3 months; and  (b) sulfasalazine at a dose of at least 2 g per day for a minimum period of 3 months; or  (c) leflunomide at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for a minimum period of 3 months.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity to necessitate permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of acceptable toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au).   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form. Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) for adult patients with severe active psoriatic arthritis.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological agents at any 1 time.  Where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab.   From 1 August 2006, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare, when swapping to the alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   Following demonstration of response to initial treatment, these biological agents are available under the PBS for continuing treatment as set out in the continuing treatment restriction for each agent.   Once patients have either failed or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a single Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy before they are eligible to commence another Cycle [further details are under '(5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' below].   The 5-year break in therapy will be measured from the date the last approval for PBS-subsidised treatment was granted in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Cycle.   Within the same Cycle, patients are not allowed to fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once. Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for any biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent which they have not previously failed, if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular treatment Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe active psoriatic arthritis after 1 August 2006.   (1)  Initial treatment.   Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); and  (ii) patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; and  (iii) patients wish to re-commence treatment with a specific biological agent following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that specific agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment for non-grandfather patients will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for all agents except for infliximab, for which a maximum of 22 weeks will be authorised.  It is recommended that patients be reviewed in the month prior to completing their course of initial treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological agent supply.   Patients must be assessed for response to any course of PBS-subsidised initial treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   Grandfather patients.   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with etanercept prior to 17 March 2005 or adalimumab and infliximab prior to 16 March 2006, may apply for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the relevant initial treatment restriction (Initial 3). These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with any biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment for all agents.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological agent, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. Patients are eligible to receive continuing biological treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   Patients must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.  Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.   (3)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate biological agent without having to re-qualify with respect to either the indices of disease severity (i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and active joint count) or the prior non-biological therapy requirements.   Patients may swap to an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.   Patients may alternate between therapy with any biological agent of their choice (1 at a time) providing:  (i) they have not received PBS-subsidised treatment with that particular biological agent previously; or  (ii) they have demonstrated an adequate response to that particular biological agent if they have previously trialled it on the PBS.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the biological agent the patient is ceasing.   (4)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the indices of disease severity submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. 20 or more active joints), response will be determined according to a reduction in the total number of active joints.   (5)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must re-qualify for initial treatment with respect to both the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with methotrexate or sulfasalazine or leflunomide, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR or CRP levels and the active joint counts are measured.	3095
9483D	Patients eligible for PBS-subsidised lipid-lowering medication (according to the criteria set out in the General Statement for Lipid-Lowering Drugs) where treatment with an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) must be reduced to a dose of 20 mg or less per day, because the patient developed a clinically important product-related adverse event during treatment with a statin.  A clinically important product-related adverse event is defined as follows:  (i) Severe myalgia (muscle symptoms without CK elevation) which is proven to be temporally associated with statin treatment; or  (ii) Myositis (clinically important CK elevation, with or without muscle symptoms) demonstrated by results twice the upper limit of normal on a single reading or a rising pattern on consecutive measurements and which is unexplained by other causes; or  (iii) Unexplained, persistent elevations of serum transaminases (greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal) during treatment with a statin	3194

9457R	Initial 2  Initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) have received prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle and are eligible to receive further biological therapy; and  (3) have not failed treatment with etanercept during the current Treatment Cycle.   Applications for patients who have demonstrated a response to PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment within this Treatment Cycle and who wish to re-commence etanercept treatment within the same Cycle following a break in therapy, will only be approved where evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment has been submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of cessation of treatment.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised biological therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy. This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2949
9458T	Continuing treatment  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults:  (1) who have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised biological agent for this condition in the current Treatment Cycle was with etanercept; and  (3) who, at the time of application, demonstrate an adequate response to treatment with etanercept.   An adequate response to treatment with etanercept is defined as:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline; AND either of the following:  (i) a reduction in the total active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline, where baseline is at least 20 active joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the number of the following major active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   All applications for continuing treatment with etanercept must include a measurement of response to the prior course of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with etanercept, it must be accompanied by an assessment of response to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with the initial treatment course.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Once patients fail to respond to treatment with 3 biological agents, they are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2951
9458T	Initial 3  Initial PBS-subsidised supply for continuing treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of psoriatic arthritis, of adults who:  (1) have a documented history of severe active psoriatic arthritis; and  (2) were receiving treatment with etanercept prior to 17 March 2005; and  (3) have demonstrated a response as specified in the criteria for continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Psoriatic Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)]; and  (3) a copy of the signed patient acknowledgement form which is included in the Supporting Information Form. Completion of this form declares that the patient understands and acknowledges that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if they do not demonstrate the response to treatment required to support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment at any assessment where a response must be demonstrated.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with etanercept will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle.   Patients may qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this restriction once only	2950
9459W	Initial 1 (new patients)  Application for initial PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received no prior PBS-subsidised treatment with a bDMARD for this condition in this treatment cycle; and  (c) have failed to achieve an adequate response to the following treatments:  (i) methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly; and  (ii) methotrexate (at a minimum dose of 7.5 mg weekly), in combination with 2 other non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for a minimum of 3 months; and  (iii) a minimum of 3 months' treatment with:   -  leflunomide; or   -  cyclosporin.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, please provide details at the time of application.   If intolerance to treatment develops during the relevant period of use, which is of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal, please provide details of the degree of this toxicity at the time of application.  Details of the accepted toxicities, including severity, can be found on the Medicare Australia website [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L;  AND either  (i) a total active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a signed patient acknowledgement.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Assessment of a patient's response to an initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.  This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with etanercept.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial etanercept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Where the term bDMARD appears in the following notes and restrictions it refers to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab), the interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra) and the T-cell co-stimulation modulator (abatacept).   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs at any 1 time.   PBS-subsidised infliximab, anakinra, rituximab and abatacept must be used in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly. Where a patient cannot tolerate 7.5 mg of methotrexate weekly, they are only eligible to receive PBS-subsidised etanercept and adalimumab.   In order to be eligible to receive PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab, a patient must have already failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 course of treatment with a PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist.   From 1 March 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a Treatment Cycle where they may trial PBS-subsidised bDMARD agents without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Treatment Cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a bDMARD while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment prior to 1 March 2008 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2008.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised bDMARD more than once.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.   For patients who have failed PBS-subsidised treatment with 3 bDMARDs prior to 1 March 2008 please contact Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270.   The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a bDMARD under the new Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new Treatment Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   If patients fail to respond to a particular bDMARD within a single Treatment Cycle, they are not eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with that drug until they commence the next Cycle.

Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in this Treatment Cycle and wishes to commence such therapy, excluding rituximab (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) bDMARD therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific bDMARD following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for etanercept, adalimumab, anakinra and abatacept, 22 weeks of therapy for infliximab and 2 infusions of rituximab.   From 1 March 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment (excluding rituximab) following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients must be assessed following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 4 weeks.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised bDMARD (excluding rituximab) treatment it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Rituximab patients:  A further application may be submitted to Medicare Australia 24 weeks after the first infusion.  New baselines may be submitted with this application if appropriate.   (b) Continuing treatment.  Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific bDMARD (excluding rituximab), a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing bDMARD treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted bDMARD supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients:  A patient may qualify to receive a further course of treatment (every 24 weeks) with this agent providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion of their most recent treatment with rituximab. The patient remains eligible to receive a course of rituximab every 24 weeks providing they continue to demonstrate a response as specified in the restriction.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised bDMARD is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate bDMARD within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the joint count) or the prior non-bDMARD therapy requirements.  However the requirement for concomitant treatment with methotrexate, where it applies, must be met for each bDMARD trialled.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   A patient may trial an alternate bDMARD at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a bDMARD at the time of the application.  However, they cannot swap to a particular bDMARD if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same Treatment Cycle.   In order to trial rituximab, a patient must have trialled and failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   PBS subsidy does not allow for patients to receive treatment with another PBS-subsidised biological agent during the required treatment-free period applying to patients who have demonstrated a response to their most recent course of rituximab.  This means that patients who have demonstrated a response to a course of rituximab must have a PBS-subsidised biological therapy treatment-free period of at least 22 weeks, immediately following the second infusion, before swapping to an alternate bDMARD.  Patients who fail to respond to rituximab and who qualify and wish to trial a course of an alternate bDMARD may do so without having to have any treatment-free period.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate bDMARD should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the bDMARD the patient is ceasing.	3224
9459W	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement)  Application for an initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of adults who:  (a) have a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) have received prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment for this condition in this treatment cycle and are eligible to receive further bDMARD therapy.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Applications for patients who have received PBS-subsidised treatment with etanercept within this treatment cycle and who wish to re-commence therapy with this drug within this same cycle, must be accompanied by evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment, within the timeframes specified below.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with etanercept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial etanercept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle\nNOTE: (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the joint count, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a bDMARD.  However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. more than 20 active joints), response will be determined according to the reduction in the total number of active joints.  Where the baseline is determined on total number of major joints, the response must be demonstrated on the total number of major joints.   The baseline joint and blood counts should be performed whilst the patient is still on treatment or within 1 month of ceasing prior treatment.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent Treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with at least 1 non-biological DMARD, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR and/or CRP levels and the active joint count are measured.   (5)  Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab or abatacept.   From 1 March 2008, a patient who commenced treatment with rituximab for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 7 March 2007 or abatacept for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 1 November 2007 and who was 'grandfathered' on to PBS-subsidised therapy, and who continues to receive treatment in the same Treatment Cycle, will have further applications for treatment with rituximab or abatacept assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.   A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once.  A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with abatacept will be authorised under this criterion.   'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first Treatment Cycle.  For the second and subsequent Cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that applies to a new patient.  See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2845
9459W	Initial treatment, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of patients aged 18 years or older with a documented history of severe active polyarticular course juvenile chronic arthritis with onset prior to the age of 18 years; AND  (a) who have signed a patient agreement form indicating that they understand and acknowledge that PBS-subsidised treatment will cease if the predetermined response criteria do not support continuation of PBS-subsidised treatment; AND  (b) who have failed to achieve an adequate response to methotrexate at a dose of at least 20 mg weekly; AND  (c) who have failed to achieve an adequate response to methotrexate, in combination with 2 other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for a minimum of 3 months; AND  (d) who have subsequently failed to achieve an adequate response following a minimum of 3 months' treatment with:  (i) leflunomide; or  (ii) cyclosporin.   If treatment with any of the above-mentioned drugs is contraindicated according to the relevant TGA-approved Product Information, or intolerance of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal develops during the relevant period of use, the patient is exempted from demonstrating an inadequate response to the above treatment regimens. Details of the contraindication or intolerance, including the degree of toxicity, must be provided at the time of application.   The following criteria must be met in order to demonstrate failure to achieve an adequate response:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L; AND either  (i) an active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder, cervical spine and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).    If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be in writing and must include sufficient information to determine the patient's eligibility according to the above criteria.  The date of joint assessment must be provided.   Where fewer than 3 repeats are requested at the time of the initial authority application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 4 months of treatment may be requested by telephone. Under no circumstances will telephone approvals be granted for initial or continuing authority applications, or for treatment that would otherwise extend the initial treatment period beyond 4 months.   The assessment of the patient's response to the initial course of treatment should be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated. Applications for continuing treatment with etanercept should be made prior to the completion of 16 weeks of treatment to ensure continuity for those patients who meet the criteria	3225
9486G	For use in patients who are receiving treatment under a GP Management Plan or Team Care Arrangements where Medicare benefits were or are payable for the preparation of the Plan or coordination of the Arrangements\nNOTE: No applications for increased maximum quantities and/or repeats will be authorised.	3035
9616D	Treatment, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, and co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily, of HIV infection in an antiretroviral experienced patient with:  (a) evidence of HIV replication (viral load greater than 10,000 copies per mL); and/or  (b) CD4 cell counts of less than 500 per cubic millimetre.  A patient must have failed previous treatment with, or have resistance to, 1 antiretroviral regimen	3279
9617E	Continuing treatment (Face, hand, foot)  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment as systemic monotherapy (other than methotrexate) by a dermatologist for adults 18 years and over:  (a) who have a documented history of severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the face, or palm of a hand or sole of a foot; and  (b) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle was with infliximab; and  (c) who have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment with infliximab.   An adequate response to infliximab treatment is defined as the plaque or plaques assessed prior to biological treatment showing:  (i) a reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) symptom subscores for all 3 of erythema, thickness and scaling, to slight or better, or sustained at this level, as compared to the pre-biological treatment baseline values; or  (ii) a reduction by 75% or more in the skin area affected, or sustained at this level, as compared to the pre-biological treatment baseline value.   This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with infliximab, the assessment of response must be after a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with an initial course.   Applications for authorisation must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes the following:  (i) the completed Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) calculation sheet and face, hand, foot area diagrams along with the date of the assessment of the patient's condition [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   The most recent PASI assessment must be no more than 1 month old at the time of application.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with infliximab will be authorised under this restriction.   At the time of the authority application, medical practitioners should request the appropriate number of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide sufficient for a single infusion at a dose of 5 mg per kg.  Up to a maximum of 2 repeats will be authorised.   Where fewer than 2 repeats are requested at the time of the application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).  Under no circumstances will telephone approvals be granted for continuing authority applications, or for treatment that would otherwise extend the treatment period beyond 24 weeks.   A PASI assessment of the patient's response must be conducted within 4 weeks prior to completion of this course of treatment.  This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for further continuing treatment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with infliximab.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   It is recommended that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised infliximab treatment.   The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area assessed at baseline.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with 3 biological agents are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	3264

A PASI assessment of the patient's response to this initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated. This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.

It is recommended that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab, for adult patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  Therefore, where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab.   From 1 March 2010, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis prior to 1 March 2010 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2010.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 biological agent at any 1 time.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once.  Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.  A patient who, prior to 1 March 2010, was authorised to receive PBS-subsidised initial treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis with the same agent twice, is exempt from this condition in respect of applications approved prior to 1 March 2010.   Patients must be assessed for response to each course of continuing treatment according to the criteria included in the relevant continuing treatment restriction.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological agent therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.  The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Treatment Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years duration has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis after 1 March 2010.   There are separate restrictions for both the initial and continuing treatment for psoriasis affecting the whole body, versus psoriasis affecting the face, hands and feet.   (1)  Application for approval for initial treatment.   Applications for a course of initial treatment should be made in the following situations:  (i)  patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii)  patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under '(4)  Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii)  patients who wish to re-commence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment in the case of adalimumab and etanercept, 22 weeks of treatment in the case of infliximab and 28 weeks of treatment in the case of ustekinumab.   Grandfather patients (adalimumab and ustekinumab only).   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 March 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 26 November 2009, may be made for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the initial treatment restriction (Initial 3).  These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with a biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Assessment of response to initial treatment.   When prescribing initial treatment with a biological agent, a PASI assessment must be conducted after at least 12 weeks of treatment.  This assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of the completion of this initial treatment course.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area as assessed at baseline.   (3)  Application for continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course of a biological agent to which an adequate response has been demonstrated, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that biological agent.  Patients are eligible to continue to receive continuous treatment with 24 week courses providing they continue to sustain a response.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to sustain a response to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   (4)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate agent within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to disease severity (i.e. a PASI score of greater than 15), or prior treatment requirements.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   Patients may trial an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.  However, they cannot swap to a particular agent if they have failed to respond to treatment with that particular agent within the same Cycle.   Patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 June 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 1 March 2010 access these interchangeability arrangements in the same way as patients who have not.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the agent being ceased.   (5)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated, based on the baseline PASI assessment submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and subsequent response will be assessed according to this revised PASI score.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same body area assessed at the baseline PASI assessment must be assessed for demonstration of response to treatment for the purposes of all continuing treatment applications.   (6)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent Biological Treatment Cycle, following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment according to the criteria of the relevant restriction and index of disease severity.  Patients must have had at least 1 prior treatment, as listed in the criteria, for a minimum of 6 weeks, and must have a PASI assessment conducted preferably whilst still on treatment, but no later than 1 month following cessation of treatment.  The PASI assessment must be no older than 1 month at the time of application.	3273
9462B	Continuing treatment (Face, hand, foot)  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment as systemic monotherapy (other than methotrexate) by a dermatologist for adults 18 years and over:  (a) who have a documented history of severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the face, or palm of a hand or sole of a foot; and  (b) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised biological treatment for this condition in this Treatment Cycle was with etanercept; and  (c) who have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment with etanercept.   An adequate response to etanercept treatment is defined as the plaque or plaques assessed prior to biological treatment showing:  (i) a reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) symptom subscores for all 3 of erythema, thickness and scaling, to slight or better, or sustained at this level, as compared to the pre-biological treatment baseline values; or  (ii) a reduction by 75% or more in the skin area affected, or sustained at this level, as compared to the pre-biological treatment baseline value.   This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with etanercept, the assessment of response must be after a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with an initial course.   Applications for authorisation must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes the following:  (i) the completed Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) calculation sheet and face, hand, foot area diagrams along with the date of the assessment of the patient's condition [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   The most recent PASI assessment must be no more than 1 month old at the time of application.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with etanercept will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the authority application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).  Under no circumstances will telephone approvals be granted for continuing authority applications, or for treatment that would otherwise extend the treatment period beyond 24 weeks.   A PASI assessment of the patient's response must be conducted within 4 weeks prior to completion of this course of treatment.  This assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with etanercept.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   It is recommended that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised etanercept treatment.   The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area assessed at baseline.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with 3 biological agents are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new Biological Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised biological agent was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle\nNOTE: No applications for increased maximum quantities and/or repeats will be authorised.	3278

An adequate response to treatment is defined as:  A Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score which is reduced by 75% or more, or is sustained at this level, when compared with the pre-biological treatment baseline value for this Treatment Cycle.   This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course.  If the application is the first application for continuing treatment with etanercept, the assessment of response must be after a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with an initial course.   Applications for authorisation must be made in writing and must include:  (a) a completed authority prescription form; and  (b) a completed Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes the following:  (i) the completed Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) calculation sheet along with the date of the assessment of the patient's condition.   The most recent PASI assessment must be no more than 1 month old at the time of application.   Approval will be based on the PASI assessment of response to the most recent course of treatment with etanercept.   A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with etanercept will be authorised under this restriction.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are requested at the time of the authority application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).

Patients must have failed previous treatment with, or have resistance to, 3 different antiretroviral regimens which have included:  (i) at least 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; and  (ii) at least 1 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; and  (iii) at least 2 protease inhibitors	2700
9611W	Continuing treatment  Continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab, in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of an adult:  (a) who has a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) who has demonstrated an adequate response to treatment with rituximab; and  (c) whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in this Treatment Cycle was with rituximab.   An adequate response to treatment is defined as:  an ESR no greater than 25 mm per hour or a CRP level no greater than 15 mg per L or either marker reduced by at least 20% from baseline;  AND either of the following:  (i) a reduction in the total active (swollen and tender) joint count by at least 50% from baseline, where baseline is at least 20 active joints; or  (ii) a reduction in the number of the following major active joints, from at least 4, by at least 50%:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   Patients may qualify to receive a further course of treatment (every 24 weeks) with this agent providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion of their most recent treatment with rituximab. The patient remains eligible to receive a course of rituximab every 24 weeks providing they continue to demonstrate a response as specified in the restriction.  The demonstration of response must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 4 weeks of assessment.   The same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial application must be used for assessment of all continuing applications.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with 3 bDMARDs are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new bDMARD Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle\nNOTE: (3) Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the joint count, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a bDMARD.  However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and Medicare Australia will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be provided for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.  Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be provided to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. more than 20 active joints), response will be determined according to the reduction in the total number of active joints.  Where the baseline is determined on total number of major joints, the response must be demonstrated on the total number of major joints.   The baseline joint and blood counts should be performed whilst the patient is still on treatment or within 1 month of ceasing prior treatment.   (4) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent Treatment Cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity.  Patients must have received treatment with at least 1 non-biological DMARD, at an adequate dose, for a minimum of 3 months at the time the ESR and/or CRP levels and the active joint count are measured.   (5)  Patients 'grandfathered' onto PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab or abatacept.   From 1 March 2008, a patient who commenced treatment with rituximab for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 7 March 2007 or abatacept for severe rheumatoid arthritis prior to 1 November 2007 and who was 'grandfathered' on to PBS-subsidised therapy, and who continues to receive treatment in the same Treatment Cycle, will have further applications for treatment with rituximab or abatacept assessed under the continuing treatment restriction.   A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criterion once.  A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment with abatacept will be authorised under this criterion.   'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first Treatment Cycle.  For the second and subsequent Cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must requalify for initial treatment under the criteria that applies to a new patient.  See 'Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' above for further details.	2852
9611W	Initial 2 (change or re-commencement)  Application for an initial course of PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab, in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of an adult who:  (a) has a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) has failed to respond to at least 1 PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist in this Treatment Cycle; and  (c) has not previously failed to respond to PBS-subsidised rituximab in the current Treatment Cycle.   Applications for patients who have demonstrated a response to PBS-subsidised rituximab treatment within this Treatment Cycle and who wish to re-commence rituximab treatment within the same Cycle following a break in therapy, will only be approved where evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised rituximab treatment has been submitted to Medicare Australia.   A patient may qualify to receive a further course of treatment (1 infusion at week 0 and 1 infusion at week 2) every 24 weeks with this agent providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion of their most recent treatment with rituximab. The patient remains eligible to receive a course of rituximab every 24 weeks providing they continue to demonstrate a response as specified in the restriction. The demonstration of response must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 4 weeks of assessment.   The same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial application must be used for assessment of all continuing applications.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [www.medicareaustralia.gov.au].   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with rituximab under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this Treatment Cycle. Patients may re-trial rituximab after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to rituximab treatment and who qualify to trial an alternate bDMARD according to the interchangeability arrangements for bDMARDs for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis, may do so without having to have a 22 week treatment-free period.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with 3 bDMARDs are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new bDMARD Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle\nNOTE: Any queries concerning the arrangements to prescribe rituximab may be directed to Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).

These patients may re-commence a new bDMARD Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle.   Patients can qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this criteria once only\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Where the term bDMARD appears in the following notes and restrictions it refers to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab), the interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra) and the T-cell co-stimulation modulator (abatacept).   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs at any 1 time.   PBS-subsidised infliximab, anakinra, rituximab and abatacept must be used in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly. Where a patient cannot tolerate 7.5 mg of methotrexate weekly, they are only eligible to receive PBS-subsidised etanercept and adalimumab.   In order to be eligible to receive PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab, a patient must have already failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 course of treatment with a PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist.   From 1 March 2008, under the PBS, all patients will be able to commence a Treatment Cycle where they may trial PBS-subsidised bDMARD agents without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Treatment Cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a bDMARD while they continue to show a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment prior to 1 March 2008 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2008.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised bDMARD more than once.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.   For patients who have failed PBS-subsidised treatment with 3 bDMARDs prior to 1 March 2008 please contact Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270.   The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a bDMARD under the new Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same Treatment Cycle.   A patient who has failed fewer than 3 bDMARDs in a Treatment Cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new Treatment Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   If patients fail to respond to a particular bDMARD within a single Treatment Cycle, they are not eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with that drug until they commence the next Cycle.   (1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy after 1 March 2008.   (a) Initial treatment.  Applications for initial treatment should be made where:  (i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD treatment in this Treatment Cycle and wishes to commence such therapy, excluding rituximab (Initial 1); or  (ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) bDMARD therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific bDMARD following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for etanercept, adalimumab, anakinra and abatacept, 22 weeks of therapy for infliximab and 2 infusions of rituximab.   From 1 March 2008, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment (excluding rituximab) following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients must be assessed following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion, and this assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 4 weeks.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised bDMARD (excluding rituximab) treatment it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Rituximab patients:  A further application may be submitted to Medicare Australia 24 weeks after the first infusion.  New baselines may be submitted with this application if appropriate.   (b) Continuing treatment.  Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific bDMARD (excluding rituximab), a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing bDMARD treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.   It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted bDMARD supply.   Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Rituximab patients:  A patient may qualify to receive a further course of treatment (every 24 weeks) with this agent providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion of their most recent treatment with rituximab. The patient remains eligible to receive a course of rituximab every 24 weeks providing they continue to demonstrate a response as specified in the restriction.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that bDMARD.   (2) Swapping therapy.   Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised bDMARD is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate bDMARD within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the joint count) or the prior non-bDMARD therapy requirements.  However the requirement for concomitant treatment with methotrexate, where it applies, must be met for each bDMARD trialled.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   A patient may trial an alternate bDMARD at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a bDMARD at the time of the application.  However, they cannot swap to a particular bDMARD if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same Treatment Cycle.   In order to trial rituximab, a patient must have trialled and failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment.   To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   PBS subsidy does not allow for patients to receive treatment with another PBS-subsidised biological agent during the required treatment-free period applying to patients who have demonstrated a response to their most recent course of rituximab.  This means that patients who have demonstrated a response to a course of rituximab must have a PBS-subsidised biological therapy treatment-free period of at least 22 weeks, immediately following the second infusion, before swapping to an alternate bDMARD.  Patients who fail to respond to rituximab and who qualify and wish to trial a course of an alternate bDMARD may do so without having to have any treatment-free period.   To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate bDMARD should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the bDMARD the patient is ceasing.	2851

In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   It is recommended that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion for PBS-subsidised infliximab treatment\nNOTE: TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS   The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological agents adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab, for adult patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  Therefore, where the term 'biological agents' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it only refers to adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab.   From 1 March 2010, all patients will be able to commence a 'Biological Treatment Cycle' (Cycle), where they may trial adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab without having to meet the initial treatment criteria, that is they will not need to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate agent.  Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single Cycle, patients may receive long-term treatment with a biological agent as long as they sustain a response to therapy.   A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis prior to 1 March 2010 is considered to be in their first Cycle as of 1 March 2010.   Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 biological agent at any 1 time.   Within the same Treatment Cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological agent more than once.  Therefore once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological agent, they must change to an alternate agent if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.  A patient who, prior to 1 March 2010, was authorised to receive PBS-subsidised initial treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis with the same agent twice, is exempt from this condition in respect of applications approved prior to 1 March 2010.   Patients must be assessed for response to each course of continuing treatment according to the criteria included in the relevant continuing treatment restriction.   Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a Treatment Cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological agent therapy before they are eligible to commence the next Cycle.  The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological agent treatment in the most recent Cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological agent under the new Treatment Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years duration has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, may commence a further course of treatment within that Cycle.   Patients for whom a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of 5 years or more has occurred, and, who have failed therapy fewer than 3 times within a particular Cycle, as defined in the relevant restriction, are eligible to commence a new Cycle.   There is no limit to the number of Biological Treatment Cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.   How to prescribe biological agents for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis after 1 March 2010.   There are separate restrictions for both the initial and continuing treatment for psoriasis affecting the whole body, versus psoriasis affecting the face, hands and feet.   (1)  Application for approval for initial treatment.   Applications for a course of initial treatment should be made in the following situations:  (i)  patients have received no prior PBS-subsidised biological treatment and wish to commence such therapy (Initial 1); or  (ii)  patients have received prior PBS-subsidised biological therapy and wish to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2) [further details are under '(4)  Swapping therapy' below]; or  (iii)  patients who wish to re-commence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2).   All applications for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment in the case of adalimumab and etanercept, 22 weeks of treatment in the case of infliximab and 28 weeks of treatment in the case of ustekinumab.   Grandfather patients (adalimumab and ustekinumab only).   Applications for patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 March 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 26 November 2009, may be made for initial PBS-subsidised treatment as continuing therapy under the initial treatment restriction (Initial 3).  These patients access the PBS interchangeability arrangements in the same way as new patients who have not been treated with a biological agent prior to PBS listing of that agent.   Applications for initial PBS-subsidised treatment for grandfather patients will provide for a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment.  Approval will be based on the criteria included in the relevant restriction.   (2)  Assessment of response to initial treatment.   When prescribing initial treatment with a biological agent, a PASI assessment must be conducted after at least 12 weeks of treatment.  This assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia within 1 month of the completion of this initial treatment course.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area as assessed at baseline.   (3)  Application for continuing treatment.   Following the completion of an initial treatment course of a biological agent to which an adequate response has been demonstrated, patients may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that biological agent.  Patients are eligible to continue to receive continuous treatment with 24 week courses providing they continue to sustain a response.   For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Medicare Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.   Where a response assessment is not submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, patients will be deemed to have failed to sustain a response to treatment with that biological agent.  In circumstances where it is not possible to submit a response assessment within these timeframes, please call Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 to discuss.   (4)  Swapping therapy.   Once an authority for initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological agent is approved, patients may swap to an alternate agent within the same Treatment Cycle without having to requalify with respect to disease severity (i.e. a PASI score of greater than 15), or prior treatment requirements.   Patients who are not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent.   Patients may trial an alternate biological agent at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy with a biological agent at the time of the application or not.  However, they cannot swap to a particular agent if they have failed to respond to treatment with that particular agent within the same Cycle.   Patients who commenced treatment with adalimumab prior to 1 June 2009 or ustekinumab prior to 1 March 2010 access these interchangeability arrangements in the same way as patients who have not.   To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.   To avoid confusion, applications for patients who wish to swap to an alternate biological agent should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the agent being ceased.   (5)  Baseline measurements to determine response.   Medicare Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated, based on the baseline PASI assessment submitted with the first authority application for a biological agent. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority is submitted within a Treatment Cycle and subsequent response will be assessed according to this revised PASI score.   To ensure consistency in determining response, the same body area assessed at the baseline PASI assessment must be assessed for demonstration of response to treatment for the purposes of all continuing treatment applications.   (6)  Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.   Patients who wish to trial a second or subsequent Biological Treatment Cycle, following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment according to the criteria of the relevant restriction and index of disease severity.  Patients must have had at least 1 prior treatment, as listed in the criteria, for a minimum of 6 weeks, and must have a PASI assessment conducted preferably whilst still on treatment, but no later than 1 month following cessation of treatment.  The PASI assessment must be no older than 1 month at the time of application.	3259

The following initiation criteria indicate failure to achieve an adequate response and must be demonstrated in all patients at the time of the initial application:  an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm per hour or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 15 mg per L;  AND either  (i) a total active joint count of at least 20 active (swollen and tender) joints; or  (ii) at least 4 active joints from the following list of major joints:   -  elbow, wrist, knee and/or ankle (assessed as swollen and tender); and/or   -  shoulder and/or hip (assessed as pain in passive movement and restriction of passive movement, where pain and limitation of movement are due to active disease and not irreversible damage such as joint destruction or bony overgrowth).   All tests and assessments should be performed preferably whilst still on treatment, but no longer than 1 month following cessation of the most recent prior treatment.   If the above requirement to demonstrate an elevated ESR or CRP cannot be met, the application must state the reasons why this criterion cannot be satisfied.   The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)] which includes details of the patient's ESR and CRP measurements and the patient's active joint count which must have been assessed no earlier than 1 month prior to the date of application; and  (3) a signed patient acknowledgement.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   At the time of the authority application, medical practitioners should request the appropriate quantity of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide sufficient for a single infusion. Up to a maximum of 4 repeats may be authorised.   Where fewer than 4 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Assessment of a patient's response to an initial course of treatment must be made after at least 12 weeks of treatment so that there is adequate time for a response to be demonstrated.  This assessment, which will be used to determine eligibility for continuing treatment, must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 1 month from the date of completion of this initial course of treatment.  Where a response assessment is not undertaken and submitted to Medicare Australia within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with abatacept.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with abatacept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial abatacept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	3220

The authority application must be made in writing and must include:  (1) a completed authority prescription form; and  (2) a completed Rheumatoid Arthritis PBS Authority Application - Supporting Information Form [may be downloaded from the Medicare Australia website (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au)].   Applications for patients who have received PBS-subsidised treatment with abatacept within this treatment cycle and who wish to re-commence therapy with this drug within this same cycle, must be accompanied by evidence of a response to the patient's most recent course of PBS-subsidised abatacept treatment, within the timeframes specified below.   A maximum of 16 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this restriction.   At the time of the authority application, medical practitioners should request the appropriate quantity of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide sufficient for a single infusion. Up to a maximum of 4 repeats may be authorised.   Where fewer than 4 repeats are requested at the time of the initial application, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised abatacept treatment was approved under either of the initial treatment restrictions (i.e. for patients with no prior PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy or, under this restriction, for patients who have received previous PBS-subsidised bDMARD therapy), patients must have been assessed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.  This assessment must be provided to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Where the most recent course of PBS-subsidised abatacept treatment was approved under the continuing treatment criteria, patients must have been assessed for response, and the assessment must be submitted to Medicare Australia no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with abatacept under this restriction will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised treatment with this drug, in this treatment cycle.  Patients may re-trial abatacept after a minimum of 5 years have elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this cycle and the date of the first application under the new cycle	2835
9621J	Initial 3 ('grandfather' patients)  Initial PBS-subsidised supply for continuing treatment with abatacept, in combination with methotrexate at a dose of at least 7.5 mg weekly, by a rheumatologist or clinical immunologist with expertise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, of an adult who:  (a) has a documented history of severe active rheumatoid arthritis; and  (b) was receiving treatment with abatacept prior to 1 November 2007; and  (c) has demonstrated a response as specified in the criteria for continuing PBS-subsidised treatment with abatacept.

The assessment of the patient's response to a continuing course of therapy must be made within 4 weeks prior to completion of that course and posted to Medicare Australia no less than 2 weeks prior to the date the next dose is scheduled in order to ensure continuity of treatment for those patients who meet the continuation criterion.   A maxiumum of 24 weeks of treatment with abatacept will be approved under this criterion.   At the time of the authority application, medical practitioners should request the appropriate quantity of vials, based on the weight of the patient, to provide sufficient for a single infusion.  Up to a maximum of 5 repeats may be authorised.   Where fewer than 5 repeats are initially requested with the authority prescription, authority approvals for sufficient repeats to complete a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment may be requested by telephone by contacting Medicare Australia on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).   Patients may qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this restriction once only.   Patients who fail to demonstrate a response to treatment with 3 bDMARDs are deemed to have completed this Treatment Cycle and must cease PBS-subsidised therapy.  These patients may re-commence a new bDMARD Treatment Cycle after a minimum of 5 years has elapsed between the date the last prescription for a PBS-subsidised bDMARD was approved in this Cycle and the date of the first application under the new Cycle	2836
