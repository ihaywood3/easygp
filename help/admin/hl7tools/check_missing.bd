.subsubsection Checking For Missing HL7 Files
During development I 'lost' HL7 Files as I had moved or copied them 'out of the way' in a disorganised fashion,
so as not to 'lose' them with the developmental code I was using which was pretty buggy.

I've included this little utility which will check the files in any directory against the hl7 files which have 
already been imported into EasyGP, and then give you a list the names of files not imported.

These may not of course be genuine hl7 files, as the file content is not verified to be HL7 by this utility.

.bold How to use this module
.item Select the directory you wish to search
.item Click the 'Start Search' button and wait... this could take a while
.item The list of files which appears in the list below are those not imported into your database.
.item To action these files, right mouse click on the file list, for example to delete a file, or 
to move or copy it to the root hl7 directory

At this point it is up to you what you do with these files. Perhaps later I will add some more 
sophisticated functionality such as viewing the message etc.
