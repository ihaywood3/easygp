.subsubsection Setting A Coding System

Many users are irritated by coding systems and cannot see their point - however once you wish to aggregate information or search for like 
conditions to do research etc, then they are imperitive.

Fortunately in the health issue section, EasyGP lets you both code your conditions via your preferred coding system

 describe them using an additional, more user-friendly free-hand text description of your choice.

.item ICD10 (supplied as the default)
The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision 
is a coding of diseases and signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances and external 
causes of injury or diseases, as classified by the World_Health_Organization (WHO)

The code set allows more than 155,000 different codes and permits tracking of many newdiagnoses and surgical Procedures,
a significant expansion on the 17,000 codes available in ICD-9. Work on ICD-10 began in 1983 and was completed in 1992.

Many such as myself may not find it particularly user-friendly. However 
it does supply a wide range of terms but tends to be 'long winded' and over detailed for general practice use. It can be 
userful where ICPC2Plus fails iexplicably to supply appropriates codes.

.item ICPC2Plus is designed to be user-friendly for Australian GP's but needs a paid subscription. 
It uses more familiar terms but has the downfall of being very very very weak in codes for operations, and inexplicably lacks consistant 
logic for simple stuff such as fractures of various bones. See 
.xref Coding - ICPC

You may use one or more at the same time when searching to code, but currently EasyGP supports keeping only 1 code per condition.
