.subsection Global Preferences

This is the section where you set preferences which apply globally to the program, for e.g file paths. 

You must first select the branch you wish to set the preferences 
for, and then, using the popup menu over the branches list, select the 'Edit' option.

.bold Document Archiving Options
.item
.bold Unfiled Documents Path
This points easygp to the location of scanned documents which need to be allocated by the clerical staff to another staff member. 
This will usually point to a network location where your file server lives.

.item
.bold Save in Database
Selecting this option will mean all documents will be saved within the database. 
If you don't select this, then your documents must be stored on a local hard drive, or a hard drive on your network. 
      The EasyGP database will me massively much smaller, and quicker and easier to backup, as 
      only the filename of the document will be associated with the patients name within the database. 
 A disadvantage of this could be your data will be split into two places, and you will have to also ensure 
 you backup the directories on your local system containing your documents. Personally I'd recommend doing this and not saving in the database.

.item
.bold Archive Site
This option is currently not implemented   

.item
.bold Archived Documents Path
This file path points to where filed documents reside - usually a network path unless you are running easygp off a single machine.

.item
.bold Server Root Hl7 Directory
This points to the location for files that are downloaded which are hl7 files.

.item
.bold Path to Library Files (network)
Usually in a networked situation your library files should reside on your file server. Individual users may also
set a 'fallback' pathway to an image of the library directory on a local machine - this could be useful for example when
taking your laptop on home visits.

.item
.bold Default Staff Member
When HL7 files are imported, if no staff member is identified, this person will be allocated 'lost documents'.

.bold Mounting Directories on your File Server

Often even though the file server is usually primarily a linux machine, you may wish to be able to access directories on a windows network, so one would set up a Samba Share.
Hence you will have to ensure that your local machine 'mounts' the network drive to a local directory. for example these lines can be inserted into a text file called 
for example mount_server

mount -t cifs //10.0.80.4/share /home/fred/ubuntu-server --verbose -o user=fred,password=mypassword

mount -t cifs //10.0.80.4/library /home/fred/ubuntu-server/library --verbose -o user=fred,password=mypassword

After saving this file, at a terminal type chmod +x  mount_server and copy the file to a directory such as /usr/bin where it can be executed as needed.
