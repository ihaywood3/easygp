.bold Mounting Directories on your File Server

Often even though the file server is usually primarily a linux machine, you may wish to be able to access directories on a windows network, so one would set up a Samba Share.
Hence you will have to ensure that your local machine 'mounts' the network drive to a local directory. for example these lines can be inserted into a text file called 
for example mount_server

mount -t cifs //10.0.80.4/share /home/fred/ubuntu-server --verbose -o user=fred,password=mypassword

mount -t cifs //10.0.80.4/library /home/fred/ubuntu-server/library --verbose -o user=fred,password=mypassword

After saving this file, at a terminal type chmod +x  mount_server and copy the file to a directory such as /usr/bin where it can be executed as needed.
