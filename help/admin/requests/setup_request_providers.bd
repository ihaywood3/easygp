.subsubsection Setting Up Request Providers
Within any general practice, there are most likely companies  where the practices doctors preferentially refer their requests for various services, for example ordering pathology tests or radiology requests.

Before any ordering can take place in EasyGP, the program needs to know what companies can be used to receive what type of requests. Setting a category to a company in the contacts database is obviously no good because there are multiple different types of category wording that could be used, eg 'pathology company' or 'histopathology provider', and some labs just specialise in one type of test and nothing else.

Admin hence, must tell EasyGP which companies fall into which categories, of course the companies must have been entered into the contacts database in the first place.

.bold Adding a provider for a type of request
.item Click the 'New' button from the request types in the edit area
.item Search for the company, and select from the popup list
.item Select a default branch that your practice may use
.item Decide if you want this to be the 'Staff Default' for this type of request
.item Click the 'Save Button'

.paragraph Making a company the 'Staff Default'

Each invididual doctor can in the User Preferences section, over-ride the practices default choices of providers, however for them to go through each category (or for Admin to do this for a new staff member) is really tedious, given they will most likely use the same companies as everyone else.

If the 'Staff Default' checkbox is checked for one provider of each type, then, whenever a new staff member with the power to use the ordering system is added, their user prefernces will be auto-populated with these defaults, which they can change as they see fit.

.paragraph Deleting a Request Provider

You will only be able to delete a provider if there have been no requests ordered under their name.
