.subsubsection User Request Provider Defaults

As individuals, we make our own choice of where we send patients to have various tests or procedures done.

In this section, you can tell EasyGP, which company you wish to use for various requests, and which branch 
you would prefer the patient to go to have the request performed.


Before using this section, your system administrator must have setup which providers belong to which category of request, 
i.e EasyGP needs to know that a company called say 'Northern Pathology', is a company which services pathology requests. 
If there are no companies available to you here, please ask your SysAdmin for assistance before proceeding.
