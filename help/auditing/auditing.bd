.section Auditing

Every time data is written to the database in EasyGP it is in some way audited, though most this occurs 'under the hood', and will not be intrusive to the user, for example every time a file is scanned in, though the user does 
not see it, an audit entry will be created in the progress notes though it will not be visible in routine clinical use. This audit trail including data time hour and minute will always be available for medico-legal reasons and can never be changed.

There may be situations where EasyGP accepts the users judgment and does not enforce an explanation for an action 
for example a popup menu in the Inbox may have an option over the documents list to 
'Delete - Preliminary Result' or 'Delete - Duplicate'. Be aware however that this action like all others 
will create an audit trail in the progress notes, though hidden from view.

However if you were for example deleting a document so it would in future not be available, you would have this 
sort of dialog popup and ask you for an explanation:

The following information will always be kept

.item The current user who is undertaking the action
.item The patient's details
.item The type of action eg Deletion
.item The table involved eg document.documents and the primary key of the role involved
.item The data being changed or deleted
.item The reason for the action (if enforced)

Other audit trails may be constructed sequentially across time, for example a document may have a number of different audit entries recorded at different times and with different staff members involved, for example its arrival time in the system 
(scanning or hl7 import), who viewed and filed it, which staff member or members had tasks allocated to the document, what the outcomes of the actioning were and who finalised the task chain.

The current user may or may not have permission to review the audit trail in its entirety but there are several ways to view the data,
 
.bold Progress Note Audit Trails

Clicking on the 'Include Audit Trail' checkbox in the clinical section will expose all progress note audit entries:

.bold Document Audit Trails

The following picture shows part of a document audit trail - whereas the components of this particular trail can be viewed sequentially across time in the progress notes, a more coherent method of tracking what happened document and any actioning you may have requested  would be to select the document in the documents list, then from the popup menu select 'View Audit Trail':
