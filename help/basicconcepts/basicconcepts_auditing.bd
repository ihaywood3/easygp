.subsection Auditing

Every time data is written to the database in EasyGP it is in some way audited, though most this occurs 'under the hood', and will not be 
intrusive to the user.

Where information is being changed from that which currently exists in the database - either when a record is being in some way changed or 
deleted, then the auditing will enforce the rule that the user enter a reason for why this is occuring 
.bold unless explicitly stated otherwise. 
For example a popup menu may have an option to undertake an action such as "Mark complete with no explanation", in which case, the user, 
by accepting this option, is taking responsiblity for this action.

For example in the scratchpad section, when you delete an item, ie it was not actioned as completed in some way, but is being removed, 
then you will have to complete this dialog:


.imagetext basicconcepts/scratchpad_audit_delete.png
The following information will always be supplied:

.item The current user who is undertaking the action - yourself
.item The patient's name
.item The type of action eg Deletion
.item The data being changed or deleted




The Reason for the action must then be supplied by the user, or the action cancelled.

As an example of reviewing audited data please see the help section for the scratch pad

.bold Note: 

This audit trail including data time hour and minute will always be available for medico-legal reasons and can never be changed.
