.subsubsection The Edit Area

.image basicconcepts/sample_editarea.png

Please note - this is 
.bold the most important part of the entire help file 

You should read this until you fully understand it. Using the editing area's effectively 
will save you buckets of time and learning to use the keyboard will mean 
.bold  **you  very rarely have to use the mouse***.

.bold Edit Area Principals
.item
.bold Add new may be the default state 
of an editing area  i.e it is to be ready to accept new data. When a section first loads, or after a save, the next action 
expected of the user is that he will want to add more data. Clicking the 'New..' button on the main toolbar
also re-sets the editing area to its expectant state of accepting new data
.item
.bold Concept of focus
- Whatever is the area of the screen being used for data entry it 'has focus' see 
.xref  The Concept of 'Focus'
 and in EasyGP if this is a textbox then focus will 
be indicated by a  green backcolor (which we could make configurable if demand was high enough), or, if a drop down combo box or button, by some visible black outlining of
the control.
.item
.bold Popup lists
 - will be presented where information exists to assist you in auto-completing data, use the down arrow key to scroll to the list not the mouse 
 and the enter key to accept the data.
.item
.bold Data is validated 
prior to save and you will be prompted for any missing data but not all data entry fields are mandatory.
.item
.bold Save (F12)
immediately saves the data to the database backend and any relevant list underneath the editing area refreshed.
.item
.bold Editing area's can be partially cleared
for example adding multiple conditions to the one family member, in which case there will be ancillary buttons under the Editing area
.item
.bold Editing area's within an edit area
can exist, for example in the contacts database and operate in principal the same as their parent except internal lists are not
saved until the entire editing area content is saved via the Save button.
.item
.bold Editing existing information in the lists 
is done by either clicking on the item in the list, which in some sections will automatically load the data back into the editing area 
as an implicit edit, or by right mouse clicking on the list and selecting 'Edit'.
.item
.bold Data is deleted
by seleting the data item from the list underneath the editing area and selecting Delete from the popup menu.
.item
.bold GUI elements 
such as textboxes and lists are adjustable by grabbing the horizontal and vertical sliders and shutdown will save this automatically.
.item
.bold Your actions will be audited 
- no matter what you do, an audit trail is kept of everything you add and delete or alter and you may be asked for an explanation. 

.bold Key usage defaults
.bold ENTER or TAB 
 will move the focus to the next control in the tab order, be it textbox or combobox etc and implicitly accepts the data 
in the textbox or combobox or checkbox. Hitting enter in a textbox will move you to the next one (although some may be 
skipped if they are rarely used) right up to the Save button.
.item
.bold DOWN ARROW
 from a textbox will move the cursor onto a popup list if the list is visible
.item
.bold SPACEBAR
  when a combobox has focus will drop down the list for that combo, or if a checkbox will check or uncheck the box
