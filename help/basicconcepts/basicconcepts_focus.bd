.subsection Focus

Gui objects are all those things which make up the screen you are viewing - the labels, textboxes, lists, buttons and so-on. Some objects 
do nothing but sit there for example a label. Others, such as lists have behaviours which allow you to scroll up and down them, and others 
such as textboxes and word processors accept data input which can be later saved by the program.

When you click on, or tab to, or arrive at by any means, an object, for example a textbox - then it 'has focus' - i.e it is the centre 
of attention for the moment. So, how do you know that an object has focus?
