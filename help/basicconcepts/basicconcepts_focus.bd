.subsection The Concept of 'Focus'

Not understanding this, a feature of all computer operating systems, is the commonest reason why users 'labour' to get around a program, or 'get lost' within a program

GUI objects are all those things which make up the screen you are viewing - the labels, textboxes, lists, buttons and so-on. Some objects 
do nothing but sit there for example a label. Others, such as lists have behaviours which allow you to scroll up and down them, and others 
such as textboxes and word processors accept data input which can be later saved by the program. When you click on, or tab to, or arrive at by any means, an object, for example a textbox - then it 'has focus' - i.e it is the centre of attention for the moment.

When an object 'has focus', the keypresses or combinations eg of key + control key, tell the computer to do something, eg when a textbox has focus and you hit the <enter> or <tab>  key, you would expect the next textbox in line to be ready to use. However, if you've not recognised that the object you want to use, e.g a textbox, does not have the current focus, and  you type on the keyboard, then if the focus is elsewhere e.g on a list or button, that object will react the the key press which could for example tell the program to save something when you really don't want it to.

If you bump a key combination as you are typing, results can be even more drastic. When I used to tutor GP's in computer use and observe them first hand, it was not unusal to see them tapping away, thinking they were entering data, only to look up and see they'd even manage to switch to another program inadvertantly or even started running another program, as they'd somehow managed to switch focus to the task bar, popup a menu, select an option and hitting enter, managed to run it. Bewildered - you bet!.

So, how do you know that an object has focus?

.paragraph Textboxes

Flashing cursor visible in textbox

.imagetext basicconcepts/focus_txtbox_green.png
Change of background colour - this will (later) be made configurable in EasyGP
.end imagetext

.imagetext basicconcepts/focus_textbox_highlighted.png
change in background colour of the selected text
.end imagetext

.paragraph Buttons

.imagetext basicconcepts/focus_buttons.png
There is usually some sort of dotted outline around buttons which have focus
.end imagetext

.bold Lists
.imagetext basicconcepts/focus_listbox.png
The line selected will be highlighted by a (usually system wide) foreground color or 'marquee'
.end imagetext

.paragraph Change in 3D

some controls such as panels and buttons may appear:


.imagetext basicconcepts/focus_no_3d.png
Flat when they have no focus
.end imagetext

.imagetext basicconcepts/focus_has_3d.png
Raised and outlined when they have no focus
.end imagetext

Being aware of these visual clues 
.bold before you start typing 
for example, will greatly reduced your surprise when you've tapped away looking at the keyboard and suddenly find that as a best case scenario nothing has been entered, or worst case, even the screen has changed.
