.subsection Principals of the Interface Design

In many medical programs, you find yourself continually running up and down menu's, clicking on buttons which load more windows, jumping from one popup window to another, and in general the screens become a dog's breakfast, and to enter data you have to click on a textbox, then pick up your mouse, move somewhere else and start the whole annoying process over again.

.bold Accessing Sections of the Program

In EasyGP we  pay hommage to menu's by having one up the top, but most of the sections of easygp are available from the main toolbar, and virtually none of the sections have popup or 'Modal' windows. As well as buttons to load each section, there are four central buttons clearly labelled as "New", "Edit", "Save" or "Print. As in a web-browser each section is loaded onto a different tab in the clinical section of the  program as your need it, and like a webbrowser you can individually close one or more tabs as needed.

.bold Data Entry - The Edit Area

Aside from writing in the word processor for progress notes:
.item 
.bold The way you enter data in one section is identical to the way you enter data in any other section
.item 
.bold The screen design for these sections look virtually identical, bar the names on the labels.
.item
.bold By learning the concept of entering data on one screen you can apply that to all the others 
.item
.bold You should try and move around the data entry using the keyboard and not jumping on/off the mouse

Hence the way enter data to write prescription is identical to how you enter data to put in a recall or write a referral, even though at first sight you would think the information very different. Using the Edit Area will be described in detail later.

.bold Making the Screen Look How You Want It 
.item
.bold Splitters allow you adjust the screen proportions to your liking 
 - These are vertical or horizontal lines which can be grabbed and moved, and in doing so you will stretch and resize the 
contents, be it textboxes or lists. Adjust these to make the interface as you would like it and use in conjunction with the Application Font which you can set in the 
.xref User Preferences 
section. 
.item 
.bold PopupMenu's
 - abound everywhere, usually over lists, but can be over panels and let you action items on the list, e.g delete, print, or let you 
   adjust things like font and colour of the list or panel.
.item
.bold Color Changes
- are used extensively to indicate diffrent things - for example that a textbox has focus or that you are missing necessary data, or for example if the Edit Area becomes highlighted by red that the  data within it has changed.

.bold Note
 that any adjustments you make to a screen will be automatically saved when the program exits. If it does not then there is a bug 
in that section and you should notify us immediately.
