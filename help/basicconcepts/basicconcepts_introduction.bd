.section Basic Concepts

In the following section we will look at some of the basic concepts of using a Linux Graphics User Interface (GUI), and you learn a little bit about how the program itself is constructed. Note that whereas navigating around a Linux Desktop is very similar to a Windows Desktop, there are differences, so it is important you read this section thoroughly

.bold Icon Sets for Buttons

Unlike Windows which has a fixed set of icons, the Linux Distribution you have installed will probably have different icon sets to those you see in this help file. In fact once you have installed your Linux Distribution there are a bewildering plethera of icon sets to customize the appearance of your computer.

Whichever icon set you choose will affect the appearance of some of the basic icons used in EasyGP eg for the pictures on the new, edit, save, print and preview buttons on the main clinical toolbar, as well as the pictures used on the buttons in the word processor in which you write your day-to-day clinical notes.

Should you not like these icons, it is easy enough as mentionied above to change them to something more to your liking via your system settings or control centre, available from the main menu of your distribution.

.bold The GUI Configuration File

As virtually every visual component in EasyGP is configurable a file will be created on your computer when EasyGP is first run, which will contain information such as the following:

.item Default sizes for visual components in the various sections eg lists, editors etc
.item Default font sizes to use in the various lists (each individually configurable)
.item Colour schemes
.item How you want the various sections of the program to behave e.g have the previous progress notes presented to you sorted from newest to oldest or visa-versa
.item If you want the patient's photo to be displayed to make selection more accurate
.item Which printers will be used for what function

etc etc.

Hopefully we have put in sensible defaults for most of these things, so the GUI should not appear too bizaare when first run, but as you explore the program, remember you can resize everything to look as you personally would like it, and these changes will be automatically saved.
