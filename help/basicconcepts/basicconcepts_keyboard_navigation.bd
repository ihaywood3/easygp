.subsection Keyboard Navigation

When computers first trickled into general practice in the mid 1990's, I spent some time coaxing, co-ercing, and tutoring doctors in the 
clinical use of computers, and spent many hours sitting side by side with them watching them struggle using the graphics user interface. Sadly 
despite all the modern advances, in my more recent visits to practices, and in watching secretarial staff use computers, it seems that very few 
persons have ever grasped the basics of navigating around a graphic user interface, nor the concept of Focus. They spend a staggering amount of 
time jumping from keyboard to mouse, clicking something, going back to the keyboard, looking for a key, and in general making life for themselves 
very difficult indeed, and probabaly tripling the amount of time they need to undertake a particular task.

When designing EasyGP we are going to great lengths attempting to make data-entry
.bold **keyboard centric**
i.e, to allow you to seamlessly navigate from textbox, to combobox, to checkbox, to list, to the final Save button which will then allow yet 
another keypress - enter - to complete the data input process. 
 
Of course this is not always possible and probably still, as EasyGP is a beta program, you may find it does not work quite as advertised, however if you drop as a line pointing this out we will do our best to rectify the situation.
 
.paragraph Key usage conventions
 
These are common by and large to windows and unix/linux systems, with one major exception that in linux there are two copy buffers - 
one filled by just swiping the text (no need to use popup menu or Ctrl C) and they other Ctrl C.

It should be possible to navigate up and down within 
.xref the edit area
 using these keys, including from combo-boxes and checkboxes 
Where this is not possible please let us know and I will insert the code.

.item  Enter and Tab  - go down from one control to another
.item Shift Tab  -go up to the next control

.bold Combox box

.item Spacebar - exposes the drop down list
.item Arrow keys go up and down
.item Enter key accepts the item

.bold Checkbox

.item Spacebar switches on and off
.item Enter key move to next control, Shift Tab back to previous control

.bold Listboxes and Columnviews

.item Arrow keys go up and down
.item Enter key accepts the current row as the selected data item and moves to the next CTRL.

.bold Special key - the Escape Key

If you are somewhere you don't want to be, or want to remove a popup for example a form preview from the screen, use ESC.

.bold ** In summary: you should resist all temptation to grab your mouse, explore the keyboard options first **
