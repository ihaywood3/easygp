.subsection Modal Windows

Modal windows are windows which effectively 'pop up in your face' and won't go away until you do something with them.

Our belief is 'the less the better', 'avoid at all costs' and that a  modal windows should never be used for data input unless absolutely necessary.

Many medical programs make the user go up and down through series of menu's and modal windows to select sections of a program or to enter clinical data or do tasks which multiplies the number of keypresses or mouse clicks to do your day to day work by a huge amount.

We limit our modal windows to either a absolutely necessary dialog such as this example:

where the user is deleting a hbaic test result and is asked to confirm the action.

or this:

where an important action is about to take place which is critical you understand.
