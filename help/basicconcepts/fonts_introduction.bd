.subsubsection Fonts

Note that the actual window borders, colours and icons on buttons and menu's shown in this help file will differ from those in your particular Linux Distribution.

There are a number of mechanisms to adjust the fonts throughout the program, but in all cases you will always be presented with a font dialog box similar to this:

.bold Program Wide Application Font 

This sets all the general fonts across the whole program and will affect the fonts of menu's, textboxes, the text on buttons etc, the popup lists within the Edit Area's, and many other lists. It will not affect the fonts of the various lists where you have specifically changed them, nor the side bar font. You can change the Application Font via the 
.xref User Preferences
 section of EasyGP, which is accessed from the main side bar which is always visible when EasyGP runs.

.bold The Side Bar Font

This is the font on the left hand side of the screen - the main side bar - which allows you to access all the major sections of EasyGP ranging from the clinical to the clerical to administrative. Again, you may change the Side Bar Font  via the 
.xref User Preferences
 section of EasyGP


.bold Fonts For Lists

Though the program wide application font will determine the font of many lists, in many sections of the program, on the popup menu that you may view by right mouse clicking on  the lists, there is an option to change the font for that specific list. Remember the icons on your menu will almost certainly differ from those in this image.

Your choie here over-rides any system wide fonts and is useful particularly to change the font size to make the lists contents fit the space available to it.
