.subsubsection Fonts

There are a number of mechanisms to adjust the fonts throughout the program, system wide application font, and fonts on 
individual controls

.paragraph Application Font

You may change the font and font size for the entire application by clicking on the little 
font button,

 located on the lower right hand side of the screen status bar. This setting is immediately applied. 

.paragraph Fonts for Lists
 
 In many sections of the program, on the popup menu that you may view by right mouse clicking on 
 the lists, there is an option to change the font for that list. This over-rides any system wide 
 font changes.
