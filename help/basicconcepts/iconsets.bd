.subsubsection Icon Sets

Unlike Windows which has a fixed set of icons, the Linux Distribution you have installed will probably have different icon sets to those you see in this help file. In fact once you have installed your Linux Distribution there are a bewildering plethera of icon sets to customize the appearance of your computer.

Whichever icon set you choose will affect the appearance of some of the basic icons used in EasyGP eg for the pictures on the new, edit, save, print and preview buttons on the main clinical toolbar, as well as the pictures used on the buttons in the word processor in which you write your day-to-day clinical notes.

Should you not like these icons, it is easy enough as mentionied above to change them to something more to your liking via your system settings or control centre, available from the main menu of your distribution.
