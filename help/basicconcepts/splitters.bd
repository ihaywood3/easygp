.subsubsection Splitters

As mentioned in the previous section splitters enable the user to re-size area's of the screen and its contents, and there are two 
types:

.bold A Vertical Splitter 
 is a container that lays out its children vertically, and that allows the user to resize them by dragging the boundary between them

.imagetext basicconcepts/horizontal_splitter.png


.bold A Horizontal Splitter 
is a container that lays out its children horizontally, and that allows the user to resize them by dragging the boundary between them. 
.end imagetext

EasyGP makes extensive use of splitters and will automatically save your resized screen area's on exit. If you find your self in a
 section of EasyGP and the screen design looks a little odd, its possible you have accidentally moved a splitter right up to the top 
or out to one edge, and hidden its contents - go take a look, grab the line and drag it back.

This help file you are reading now, has a vertical splitter separating the chapters/topics from the text you are reading - try 
adjusting this as practice in using splitters.
