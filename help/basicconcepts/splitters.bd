.subsubsection Splitters

As mentioned in the previous section splitters enable the user to re-size area's of the screen and its contents. Each Linux Distribution varies in how these splitters look, some can be a straight line, some only a small section of dashes, some can be hard to see. When using EasyGP if you look at a screen and think some portion is bizaarly small, or the textboxes in an editing area way to big for you, and you can't immediately see a splitter but expect one should be there, run your mouse over the area it will change to a double sided horizontal arrow when you are hovering over the splitter. Selecting a different them may help. For example on Linux Mint distribution with the 'Mate' desktop and the MCity-Graphite window borders theme, they are usually clearly visible as a gray line.

There are two basic types of splitter:

.bold A Vertical Splitter 
 is a container that lays out its children vertically, and that allows the user to resize them by dragging the boundary between them
.end imagetext

.imagetext basicconcepts/horizontal_splitter.png


.bold A Horizontal Splitter 
is a container that lays out its children horizontally, and that allows the user to resize them by dragging the boundary between them. 
.end imagetext

EasyGP makes extensive use of splitters and will automatically save your resized screen area's on exit. If you find your self in a
 section of EasyGP and the screen design looks a little odd, its possible you have accidentally moved a splitter right up to the top 
or out to one edge, and hidden its contents - go take a look, grab the line and drag it back.

This help file you are reading now, has a vertical splitter separating the chapters/topics from the text you are reading - try 
adjusting this as practice in using splitters.
