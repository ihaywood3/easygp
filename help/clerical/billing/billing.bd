.subsection Billing

.subsubsection Importing the Medicare Benefits Schedule

In order to use billing you must import the MBS into the database.
This must be done form the Linux command-line
.bold on the server machine.

Find where the database files have been installed, this will
be /usr/share/easygp/ if you used the debian packages, and
wherver you put them if you downloaded directly from subversion,
and move into this directory.

.pre
cd /usr/share/easygp/
.end pre

Next make sure you khow to connect to your database, usually
the same machine using the administrator password you provided
when installing the database.

The tool takes the following command-line switches:

.item -U the username to log in as
.item -d the name of the database to log in to, default "easygp"
.item -p the password to use
.item -h the hostname of the server to connect to, usually "localhost"
.item -f the name of the file containing the MBS schedule as XML
(if not provided the tool will try to download it itself, this
is a large file, over 8 megabytes, so can take a while)

An example:

.pre
./import_mbs.py -U easygp -d localhost -p your-password
.end pre
