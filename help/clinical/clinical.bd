.section Clinical Desktop
All data related to patient care is entered here. Before you can enter clinical data, there are several things which must be performed or configured.

.paragraph Staff Members must be entered in the database

Any of the staff in the practice  who will be using EasyGP for clinical or clerical purposes must have been entered in the contacts 
database. This is accessed from the main sidebar by clicking the staff members button. An appropriate access level for clinical data 
must be allocated (see 
.xref Practice Staff
)

.paragraph Lookup Data needs to be imported

EasyGP needs data to function and at a minumum this will need to be some source of

.item Patient Demographic Data  must be be entered by hand, or imported  en-mass (see 
.xref Patients
). There is a single patient for you to play with 'Mr Test Patient' already present in the database
.item Coding system data  must be selected and imported (see 
.xref Importing Coding Data
)
.item Drug Data must be selected and imported (see 
.xref Importing Drug Data
)

.paragraph Providers need to be added

 Providers are persons or companies providing services to your practice -e.g pathology providers, cardiologists, physiotherapists, psychologists.
Whereas EasyGP will function for clinical notes without these, it will be severely limited (see 
.xref Contacts Manager
and 
.xref Allocating Categories
)

.paragraph HL7 Downloading needs to be configured.

This is explained in detail in documents section (see
.xref Inbox
)

.bold A Configuration file needs to be present

Without this tiny little file, the GUI is going to be a real mess - called easygp.conf, it should have be installed when you first 
loaded EasyGP and it is usually found in your /home/user/.config/easygp directory.

Finally, reading this help file from top to bottom would be of great assistance.
