.subsubsection Problem Oriented Records

What is a problem oriented medical record (POMR)? 

There as many definitions, but put simply it is a record in which the user decides 
the nature of a patients health issue or problem, and then during each encounter with the patient, re-asseses the status of 
each problem individually, updating it's history, or changing it's management -  or - when problems are related does so in 
the context of this relationship.

In a good POMR it is possible to historically travel backwards and forwards up the problem 
tree to get a wholistic overview of the problem, as well as view this problem  in relationship to all other problems. 

A good example of an excellent medical records program which has for more than a decade used POMR very effectively is Profile

 although unfortunately, even as we near the end of the first decade of the 21st Century, this feature of medical records  is still 
poorly implemented by many software vendors.


Even  where a reasonable problem list is kept, most of the common medical software programs ,in use in Australia today 
with some notable execptions such as Profile mentioned above have only a 
single data-entry screen for progress notes - i.e - like in the old days of paper - the user writes his jotted notes about 
the patients many conditions in the same spot in the medical record- not linked or tagged to any particular disease state. 

This makes it very difficult when reviewing the patient to see, over a period of time, just what happened to the patient's management of a single 
condition such as diabetes, heart failure, or hypertension. 

In addition, incredibly, some of the commonly used medical records programs view progress notes by clicking on a date in a 
list to dispaly the text for only that date, and are unable to scroll back and forth through the days in a seamless manner.

.paragraph The EasyGP Approach to Implementing a POMR

All the patient's 'health issues', 'problems', or 'past history items' are entered in the
.xref Past History 
section. To enter progress notes, the user selects a problem from the lists always present on the main screen and a separate 
progress notes editor is used for each problem. This will be looked at in detail later in this document. As every action in 
EasyGP is audited, at any time a complete historical record of changes made over time,  or the entire 
problems progress notes for this problem can be viewed. In Addition the normal format of aggregated daily progress notes 
can be viewed.

Consultations which do not fall into a problem area, or are minor, can be entered in a general notes section.
