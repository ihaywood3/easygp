.subsubsection Historical Summary

The historical summary, as the name suggests, is a summarised description about the health issue, including presentation, evolution 
of the condition, relevant investigations and results and current status.

The purpose of this, as described previously is to allow other clinicians to be able to understand where the patient is at 
with the particular health issue, to be able to take over, if you are not present.


Though this sounds like it would take up alot of space, it is by definition a summary and should be kept brief but 
with enough information to be informative.

As time passes and the patients condition evolves, new information will have to be added, the summary modified. 

As the progress notes are written on a per health issue basis, the existing summary will always be shown 
underneath the progress notes editor, and should be updated when there is a significant change so that this change 
will automatically be carried over into the patients care plan.
