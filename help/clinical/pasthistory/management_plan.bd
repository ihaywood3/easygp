.subsubsection Management Plan Summary

.imagetext clinical/pasthistory/past_history_management_summary.png

This should be a succinct summary of how you wish the patient to be managed.

Remember that this is a summary, not an epistle - you wish to convey to any read exactly how this patients 
health issue is being treated and monitored. This can include reference to commonly known terms used by general 
practitioners, for example here the Diabetic Annual Cycle of Care.

.paragraph Updating the Managment Plan summary

As you will most certainly add progress notes on a per health issues basis, you will always have the 
management plan summary visible underneath the progress notes editor as you add notes for the current consultation.

You should update this plan at the time if any major changes occur as this will carry over to the patients care plan 
automatically.

A reminder about the configurablity of the screen:

 If all the text isn't showing (or if the historical summary and 
the management plan are not showing, then clicking over one of the 
.xref splitters 
will alow you to drag that area of the screen to reveal all, or resize the text windows.

Note once again that any text which has been changed but not saved will be outlined in red, until either 
explicity saved by you when you press the F12 key, or by closing the tab, or closing EasyGP itself.
