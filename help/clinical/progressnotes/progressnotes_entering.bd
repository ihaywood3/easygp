.subsubsection Entering Notes

By double clicking on the health issue you wish to add notes to, a new tab is created in the main workspace, titled 
after the health issue itself, in this case diabetes. Each tab hence represents a unique health issue, except of course 
for the general notes tab.

Existing notes are displayed to the left of the progress notes editor. Note also that the
.xref historical summary
 and the 
.xref management plan summary
 for the condition are displayed under the progress notes editor.
