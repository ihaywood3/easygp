.subsection The Scratch Pad

This innocuous little section is possibly one of the most useful parts of the the entire EasyGP program and 
is essentially equivalent to a jotting pad or a 'skicky note'.

You can add here all those little reminders and notes about the patient that don't quite fit into 
the clinical record but about which you need to be made ware of at subsequent visits.

The start up state of the scratch pad is an 'implicit edit' - i.e, the empty textbox means any data entered  
will be treated like a new item.

Its single textbox is like a mini editing area - see 
.xref The Edit Area
, with one important difference - due to the constraints of its size, there is no save button 
so after data is typed into the text box,  hitting the enter key will add it as a new item on the scratchpad list.

.paragraph New Scratchpad Item

As you add a new scratchpad item the editing area is outlined in red indicating data needs to be saved.


If you delete the text in before saving, or click the  
 .image clinical/scratchpad/scratchpad_reset.png
 button, then the editing area is reset.


After hitting the enter key, the new item is transferred to the scratchpad list.
