Social history is often neglected in clinical notes as we watch the continued demise of general practice 
and it's disappearance into a business run by corporations on a $$basis, where the practioners come, do their 
job, treat symptoms and leave.

However for those of us old enough to have looked after patients longitudinally for decades, a good 
social history is the cornerstone of patient care.

You can enter your social history  via the family history section and, as per the example here we 
would suggest the following minimum details:
