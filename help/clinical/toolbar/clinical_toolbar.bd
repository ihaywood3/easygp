.subsection Main Toolbar

When you first access the clinical section from the Clinical Desktop button on the side bar, you will be 
presented with the startup screen which contains the main clinical toolbar at the top.

Note the various panels on the toolbar are separated by vertical lines technically known as splitters (these may not appear as lines on your linux distribution depending on your configuration e.g they could be a row of little vertical dots). What each of these panels contain, and their function, will be explained in  detail later. You may resize any panel  of the toolbar by selecting these vertical lines with your mouse and dragging them to the desired position (see 
.xref Splitters
 in the section on customizing the screen display). You may have to experiment with this pulling one splitter  one way, another in the opposite way,  to get optimal results.
 

In particular note that if this is the very first time you have run EasyGP, that in the middle panel of the toolbar, there is an empty section in the middle third - this will later your choice of buttons used to access the various clinical modules of EasyGP - for example workcover, requests, referrals etc. As an aside - all clinical modules in EasyGP are accessible from the 'Clinical Modules' menu, found on the drop down menu at the top of the screen - you can see this in the picture below. If you don't use a particular module much, it may be better to remove its button and just access it from this menu, so as not to clutter your toolbutton panel.

Below is an example of all available buttons which when loaded should look something like this.

If you happen to be a good icon designer we would love a dedicated icon-set for EasyGP. Currently we've used open source icons or some hand-drawn icons which may not be the neatest, and there is no unifying colour theme.... mea culpa!
