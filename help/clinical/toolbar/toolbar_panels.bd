.subsubsection Toolbar Panels

.paragraph Patient Details

A patient's record is loaded by typing into the combo box text area shown in this diagram. For subtleties of use see 
.xref Finding a Patient
.
 Once the patient has been selected their photo will be displayed (if it exists) along with information such as contact details, medicare or repatriation numbers, smoking or pregnancy notification, birthdate, occupation etc.

.paragraph Middle Toolbar Panel

.image clinical/toolbar/toolbar_section_buttons.png

On the top row, you can use checkboxes to refine the patient search, to include patients who may be deceased as well as change the type of consultation from the drop down combo box which in this picture has been set by default to 'At consulting rooms' see 
.xref Consultation Types


The next row contains buttons which control the various clinical sections of EasyGP and have been selected on a a per-user basis see 
.xref Toolbar Buttons

The bottom row of buttons are fixed by the system, starting on the left we have buttons for
.item General Progress Notes
.item Health Summary
.item GP Management Plan
.item Care Plan
.item The New, Edit, Save, Print, Preview and Refresh buttons

.paragraph The New, Edit, Save, Print, Preview and Refresh buttons

These buttons are central to using EasyGP. When any particular clinical module is opened will have to 'do something' with it. For example if you have loaded the Requests section, you would expect to be able to create a 'New' Request form or to 'Print' the request form. If you had opened the Health Issues section you would expect to be able to create a 'New' health issue or to be able to 'Save' the health issue etc. If you were viewing the Health Summary you would expect say to be able to 'Print' the summary. Hence each of these buttons are either enabled or disabled according to the expected actions to be undertaken in each section.


.paragraph Allergies & Sensitivities Panel


.image clinical/toolbar/toolbar_section_allergies_popup_menu.png

The default state of this panel is to remind the user that there are no allergies or sensitivities recorded. In this image I've included the popup menu, accessed by right mouse clicking over the panel. With this you can adjust the display font, or quickly tell EasyGP that the patient has no allegies or senstivities. This data may of course be changed later by accessing the 
.xref Allergies
 module. The next image shows a patient with both allergies and sensitivities. The allergies are displayed in red, any sensitivies in displayed in black.
