.subsection Add Contact Method

We use the term 'contact method' or 'communication' in the broadest sense. Gone are the days when a persons 'home phone' was a fixed land line. 
This century it is more likely to be a mobile phone, VOIP etc, rather than a fixed line. Hence a 'communication' is any method 
of contacting a person.

.paragraph Adding a New Contact Method

Clicking the add new button within the editing area will clear any text in the contact details area, the cursor will appear 
in the 'value' textbox.

Here you should enter the details such as the phone number, web address etc.

 As there is a small amount of intelligence built in, EasyGP will recognise if the text represents 
a mobile phone, web address or email address and set the  type combo box accordingly.

If this cannot happen automatically e.g it is a home phone, then it is important you set the type accurately, 
and clicking the type combo-box will give you a complete list of options.
