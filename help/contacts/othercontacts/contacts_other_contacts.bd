.section Other Contacts
As previously mentioned, in EasyGP, although all the actual data is kept in the same tables within the database, for the purposes 
of data entry, there is a functional separation of contact information into three sections - 
.xref Patients 
, 
.xref Practice Staff
, and 
Other Contacts

Other contacts are considered to be
.item Organisations and their employees, and this includes your own general practice, although you must enter staff specific details 
such as logon names, security levels etc. within the staff module, as these are specific to your organisation alone.
.item Persons  not employed by an organisation, for example a 'lone practitioner' or 'specialist' who may have their own rooms 
but are not part of a company per se.
