.item Rebuild - will erase any existing patients in the database. This is not possible once the database is
 being used for clinical purposes
.item Update  - will attempt to update addresses for existing patients. There may be situations where a person 
has changed their name or a birthdate was incorrectly input from the original database and has since been corrected. EasyGP 
will attempt to take these possibilities into account and prompt you where ambiguities arise.
.item Add New since last update - will add only those patients not already present in the database.

.bold Data Verification Process

If everything is satisfactory, click the 'import button'. EasyGP will perform some basic analysis of your data
.item Town/Suburb spell checking - for example it will attempt to replace mis-typed names
.item Postcode check - with insertion of correct or missing postcodes
.item Firstname/Sex check - with insertion of sex
.item Title check if possible, defaulting to Ms or Mr for ages > 18 where marital status obviously cannot be deduced

Any errors will be listed below the import error.

Once completed you may have to go back to the source database and correct any errors. Once happy click the import button.
