.subsubsection Finding Patients

There are two options when searching for patients

.bold Display All Patients

By clicking on the little search icon a list of all patients will appear in the patients list box. This is  
.bold not recommended 
as your database could have many thousands of patients. This is equivalent to typing the wildcard character 
'%' in the search textbox (which is also shown above in the picture).

.subsubsubsection Selecting patients by pre-defined criteria

There are a number of inbuilt queries mechanisms you can type into the patients search box, which is the little 
textbox to the right of the binocular icon shown above.  

.item
.bold Surname,Firstname  

'j smit' gives a list of all patients with  firstname starting with 'j' and surname with 'smit'

.item
.bold Surname only 
'smith,' gives a list of all patients with surnames  = 'smith'
.item
.bold Firstname only 
.item
'peter'  gives a list of all patients with firstnames = 'peter'
.item
.bold Surname, [Firstname] [sex] [age = < > [between]
.item
 'peter, age>50' gives a list of all patients with firstname peter, age over 50yrs
.item
'mary'  s=f age between 40-50 gives all 'mary's' aged between 40 and 50

If these fail to work please let us know as though the code is in place they may not yet be 'hooked up'.
