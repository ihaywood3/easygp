.subsubsection Views

.bold ** THERE MUST BE A UNIQUE VIEW KEY IN EASYGP VIEWS **
 

Creating a view is a way of presenting data. They tend to be complex and often are combinations of both many tables, 
and joins to other views, which themselves could contain dozens of tables. 
This is a consequence of the heavy normalisation of the EasyGP database.

We rely heavily on views to return data from the database in collections for delivery to the gui for display. 
Each row in the view = one unique set of data and as such must have a unique key to identify it in a collection and it must 
be prefaced by pk, even if it is not a pk in any existing tables  as in the example below.

There may be occasions, such as below where using what should be the obvious primary key does not result in a unique key 
for a row, such as in contacts where there is a one-to many relationship between a patient and their addresses.

In these situations a compound view-key must be constructed â€“ it is immaterial to the program what you use to do this as 
long as it is unique, but in this case the view key will not be an integer but a string, and  the code in your form which 
displays the data must be adjusted accordingly ie  in the defination section 

private pk_view as string
