.subsubsection Adding a New Drug

The Australian PBS drugs which are supplied with EasyGP and updated monthly will suffice for 99% of your 
prescribing needs, however there are many private medications we also commonly use, for example most 
vaccinations needed for travel purposes are not on the Australian PBS. Also you may have your own 
formulations that you get a chemist to mix up, or want to prescribe creams for skin conditions which are 
not listed on the Australian PBS.

In these situations, you may have to add your own drug, and you can share this drug with EasyGP Central 
where it will be checked and included in drug updates sent to other users.

To start adding a new drug you will need the product information file. These can usually be downloaded from 
.link https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/
, and should be added to the product information directory on your file server 
or local machine - this path should have been set in Admin on the Global Preferences tab. Should there be no 
product information file with the TGA eg OTC or chemist ony drugs  you may have to search the internet. Many 
companies have downloadable pdf's on their website eg for Phenergan, which is not listed in the TGA.

.bold Entering The Drug Details

This process can be either quick and simple or at times may seem nearly impossible - due to problems 
with deciding what are the the generic names and associated strengths of some drugs - due to difficulty 
interpretting the product information. It is vital however that this be 
accurate as this information will be printed on your prescriptions, and used internally by EasyGP for 
allergy checking and to supply things like use in pregnancy. To start click the 'Add New' icon

  on the toolbar at the top of the screen

.italic ** If in any doubt, do not add the drug, but email the developers for assistance.**

You will need to search the drug pdf to find most of the drugs details. The combo box at the top of the drug pdf 
may assist you, you could also type in explicit text in the search textbox at the bottom of the pdf display.

.bold Check the drug does not already exist 
 - type its name in the search textbox to try and find it. Be particularly careful here, as brand names are often spelt with spaces, dashes (-) or periods (fullstops:'.') for example E.E.S, or DI-GESIC.If not found, click on the 'Add New' button on the toolbar at the top of the screen.
.item
.bold Cloning an Existing Drug
 - If you know the drug brand you wish to insert is exactly the same, or similar to an existing drug, type in the name of the existing drug and bring up the right mouse menu, and select 'Clone Drug'. This will keep the skeletal informaation of the drug including its generic components. These incidentally can be edited to change the strength or even add or delete extra generic components to your new drug. You will of course still have to need to execute many of the following steps. See
.xref Cloning An Existing Drug 
 for more information.
.item
.bold The Brand Name
Type in the brand name - the name should be auto-capitalised and when you hit the enter 
key, EasyGP will attempt to find a matching product information file which should appear in the pdf 
viewer on the right hand side of the screen if you named the pdf the same name as the drug. If you are making up your own drug or say cream mixture, you could call the brand for example Dr DICKS EMULSIFYING CREAM.
.item
.bold The Company
- this is usally listed in the pdf under the sub-heading of 'Sponsor', usually 
located on the last page. If the company does not exist or the drug you are entering does not have a company (e.g your own mixture for a  cream or a tablet compounded by a compounding chemist), you may still save the drug. However if the Company does exist you should email  the EasyGP Developers and request the name be added to the drugs database.
.item
.bold The Generic Component(s)
You will have to search the product information for these. This can be very simple e.g 
if adding DI-GESIC you probably already now the drug contains dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride and paracetamol, or extemely difficult if the 
drug contains multiple ingredients. As you type in the Find Generic textbox, EasyGP will try and give you a list of generic names already in 
the database which match what you are starting to type - if you are luckly you will get an exact match. If so, clicking the Add button next to the 
textbox will add the components into the generics grid. If the generic components in the popup list are not quite exact, for example the only match you can 
find has three generics, and you only want to use two of them in your new drug, you can still click the add button, then using the popup menu over the 
grid, you can delete the component you don't want. If the strengths of the generics in your new drug are different to those in your template generic 
you can just double click over the strength and change it to a new strength, remembering of course to add the 'mg' etc after the amount eg 500mg or 10ug.
.item
.bold The ATC Name (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System) 
Finding this is usually fairly easy, however be aware that ATC groups may be spelt differently eg estrogen and not oestrogens as many of us would write.
if you type in the generic component of your drug, for example, if adding DI-GESCIC, by typing in 'dextrop' you would get this list: 
.image drugs/di-gesic-atc-possibilities.png
.item
.bold The Formulation
 - i.e tablets, oral liquid, nasal spray. If the drug is a liquid, you will have to enter the amount of liquid and its strength for example the drug may 
 come in 100mls, so the amount is 100, and from the strength combobox you would select say 'mg'.
.item
.bold The Pack Size
  For Syrups or liquid this will be typically '1'. For tablets this is usually the number of tablets in a pack, but in some cases for contaceptives where the 21 
  or 28 tablets are considered '1 month', then the pack = 1, or 2, or 3 etc. Very confusing!
.item
.bold The Schedule
  You will have to search the product information for 'Schedule', usually most drugs are S4, be aware that a small number are S8 so you should check carefully.
.item 
.bold Sharing with EasyGP Central
  Should you wish to share your drug, check the appropriate checkbox and the drug defination will be mailed to us, checked and distributed to all users.

.bold  A completed drug would look something like this:
