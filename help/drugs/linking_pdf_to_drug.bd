.subsubsection Linking Product Information PDF to Drugs

Although easygp comes with an extensive range of product information files, in the form of pdf's, they may not always suit your needs. If you download a drug monograph 
in the form of a pdf, you can import the pdf name into your database via the Admin.Drugs module.

You must first place your file in the product information directory See

.paragraph Notes on Accuracy 

It can be easy to make a mistake when allocating a pdf to a drug name, unless you have specifically downloaded 
for your own use, a pdf from the manufacturer or the TGA website and it clearly refers to only one brand.

 The following is a suggested method.
.item Click on the pdf to view the product information.
.item Select the drug by typing in the search textbox the name of the brand.
 (sometimes Easygp will be able to automatically pull in a few suggestions for you).
.item Having a list of possible drugs which match the product information you should search the pdf for the section which contains 
information about the drugs tablet sizes and packs. This is usally called - 'PRESENTATION AND STORAGE'. 
You can do this selecting the section from the combo box at the top of the pdf display form, 
or if that fails, by typing the key words in the pdf search textbox at the bottom of the pdf display form.
.item Once you have found the  section, you will easily see which brands of the drug pertain to the pdf 
file you are viewing. You should stick strictly to that information.
.item Once you are happy your choices are accurate you should click the Link Button and the data will be committed to your database, and emailed to the developers 
if the file is not one you have downloaded for your own use.

.paragraph Example

You are viewing a pdf file which at the top identifies the pdf as the drug CECLOR and there are several brands including ceclor and ceclor CD and it comes in the form of 
powder and tablets. You would need to inspect the Ceclor product information to determine if the file covers all these brands, or only the ceclor products 
and not the ceclor CD products. Sometimes a file which seems to refer to just the tablet form of the drug, will also contain the syrup presentations, at other times the pdf 
could refer to the name of the drug, and you may have the drug in the form of tablets and capsules, but when you inspect the pdf, only the tablets are listed.

.paragraph Product Information Files Not Supplied by EasyGP

When these are used, the filename is kept in a separate field within the EasyGP database, and will never be emailed to the developers. When diplaying 
product information within EasyGP clinical sections, the program will first attempt to use your preferred pdf, but will fall back to one of the 
distributed pdfs if your own version is missing.
