.subsection Medical Record Export Wizard

With this wizard you may

.item Export whole or part of the patients medical record
.item Export format - this is currently only possible as a pdf file

The pdf created by this export process will be generated after a few simple choices and the page start of each section will be included in the table of contents. As the finished pdf is generated from a mixture of pre-existing pdf's each with their own page numbers, pdf's generated from latex or html, the page number at the top of these pages will not reflect the page number within the actual pdf

Sections which contain documents for example specialist letters, incoming results, or workcover forms can optionally be exported as single pdf files.

.bold Excluding Information From Export

The default export will include everything except that within the patient's social or past history, items marked as confidential will not be exported. Should you want to exclude specific letters, results, or progress notes, click the  'selected notes', 'selected letters' or 'selected results'
 option buttons and you can manually select only what you want to include.

.bold Including Audit Trails

It is not usually recommended to include the audit trail of each documents as the resulting output can be large and take a long time. This may however be needed for medico-legal reasons. Including the audit trail of the progress notes however is quick and this in itself will contain some information about importing and actioning of documemnts, plus a record of actioning of all tasks and recalls.

.bold Limitations of Ordering Results and Letters

You may check the checkboxes to order for example your letters by sender. If however you have not been consistant within your contacts database these could still be out of order. For example you/your staff could have allocated letter to a cardiologist working in his own premises, and then again working in a hospital clinic. At this point in time, each of these subsets would be ordered in their own list, not all under the name of the cardiologist.
