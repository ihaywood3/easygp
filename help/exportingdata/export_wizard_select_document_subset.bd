.subsection Selecting Letters or Results For Export
Sometimes you may not wish to export the entire list of a patient's incoming letters or results. For example you may have received a request from an insurance company, a subpoena or a legal request and not wish to divulge confidential or irrelevant material.

From the tabbed lists on the right hand side of the screen you have access to the referral letters and results, as you do during the normal use of EasyGP. As you probably already do in the letter writer, you may select one or more of the documents you wish to include in your export and drag and drop them onto the list of included documents, to the left of this help labelled 'Included Documents'.

.bold Filtering Results

Remember that underneath the results list you have two textboxes, the left hand with the search icon allows you to filter i.e display only one type of result. The text box to the right of this is the 'exclude' textbox. You can type in here to filter out results. For example you may have a patient who is on a drug testing program but not want this revealed to the world. You could type in 'drug screen', assuming this is the tag you gave that type of results, and all drug screen results would be excluded from the list. You could then drag whatever is left or part thereof into the export wizard.

.bold Filtering Incoming Letters

Similarly you can filter letters using the textboxes underneath the Incoming Letters list, either by content of the user tag or sender or author of the document.

.bold Multi-Selecting Documents

This can be a bit fiddly at times but you can select part of the list by one of two methods, then drag and drop the documents across to the Wizard.

.item
.bold Using the Control Key only
 - This will allow you to select one document at at time. Hold down the control key and click on each item you wish to include
.item
.bold Using the Shift & Control Keys
 - This will allow you to selet a block of documents at a time. Click on the first item you wish to include and depress the shift and control keys together, then move to the last item you wish to include (event if this means scrolling down the list using your mouse).
