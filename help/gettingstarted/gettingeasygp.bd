.subsection Getting EasyGP

There are two ways you can get an EasyGP installation up and running. Unfortunately even the easy way will at present need you to be able to use the command line and edit a text file.

.bold Bleeding Edge - The Hard Way (Developers and Masochists only)

If you are really interested, we will assume you know a little about Linux so very little detail will be given here. If you don't what bash, subversion or man pages are then bypass this and goto the easy way. If you know all these we won't need to explain much to get you started.

.item  Install the latest version of Gambas3 either from subversion or a ppa eg kendek's ppa
.item  Download the EasyGP svn from svn://ozdocit.org/easygp
.item  Download and install Postgresql version 9.1 or greater
.item  Install any dependencies you stumble on whilst trying to run EasyGP
.item  Read the manpage in the svn/easygp/db directory which will tell you how to build the EasyGP database from sources
.item  Bring the database version up to the latest by running the update scripts int he db/updates directory
.item  Load EasyGP into Gambas once you run the project you will be prompted to install missing dependencies.
.item  Download pgAdmin3 for database development/maintenance.

.bold The (Relatively) Easy Way  (Still needs a little Linux Knowledge)

We hope in the near future that EasyGP will be available from the Software Sources of the major distributions. At the moment you will have to know enough about linux to add these lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list file from a terminal. Lets say your name is fred:

.item Edit your sources file e.g fred@laptop$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
.item Add these lines to your sources.list file

deb ftp://ozdocit.org/pub/easygp/ /

deb-src ftp://ozdocit.org/pub/easygp/ /

.item Update your system fred@laptop$ sudo apt-get update

If running EasyGP only on a local machine:

.item Install all packages locally fred@laptop$ sudo apt-get install easygp-server easygp-client easygp-doc pgadmin3


If running EasyGP with the database on a file server then you should install the easygp-server package on that file server and the remaining two packages on your local machine.

EasyGP will be installed and an icon will be in your menu, usually along with other Office applications.


When running EasyGP for the first time a setup wizard will appear.

.subsection Setup Wizard

If the database has been successfully built, a default user called 'easygp' will have been created. 
If you inspect the database using pgAdmin, it should look something similar to this:

.image gettingstarted/pgadmin-users.png


The user 'easygp' has the permissions necessary to allow you to access the EasyGP database, to add your general practice 
as a new organisation and to create a system administrator.

Note the user 'easygp' is not and will never be a  'staff member' and as such cannot run the clinical sections of the program. 

After the database wizard has been run, you should logon as 'easygp' or the sysadmin you created, and enter any further 
.xref staff members
 or 
.xref organisations
 that you wish.

.include gettingstarted/setup-wizard.bd
.subsection Importing data
.subsection Starting EasyGP

.image gettingstarted/logon.png

When you first run EasyGP you will be presented with the logon screen
.item Host is the address of the server running an easyGP database, either on the local network or 
on the Internet. It will usually be set to the default `localhost' (meaning the same computer), but can be a domain name or an IP address.
.item Database is the name of the database you wish to access, almost always `easygp'.
.item User is your user code, usually your initials. Remember the easygp administrator user is always `easygp'.
.item Password is your assigned password. For the admin user this was entered during the install process in
.xref Building your Database
. Note this adminstrator user can't access clinical screens: for medico-legal reasons any clinical action taken by a user
must be mappable to a real person. user accounts with real people's names can be created through the Contacts
section (
.xref contacts manager
) which the administrator does have access to.

.subsection Closing EasyGP

EasyGP can closed like other graphical application by using the button in the far right corner (the appearance varies from system to system)
