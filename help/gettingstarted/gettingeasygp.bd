.subsection Getting EasyGP

There are two ways you can get an EasyGP installation up and running. Unfortunately even the easy way will at present need you to be able to use the command line and edit a text file.

If you are really interested, we will assume you know a little about Linux so very little detail will be given here. If you don't what bash, subversion or man pages are then bypass this and goto the easy way. If you know all these we won't need to explain much to get you started.

.item  Install the latest version of Gambas3 either from subversion or a ppa eg kendek's ppa
.item  Download the EasyGP svn from svn://ozdocit.org/easygp
.item  Download and install Postgresql version 9.1 or greater
.item  Download pgAdmin3 for database development/maintenance.
.item  Read the manpage in the svn/easygp/trunk/db directory which will tell you how to build the EasyGP database from sources
.item  Bring the database version up to the latest by running the update scripts in the db/updates directory
.item  Run EasyGP and after after it stops complaining about missing dependencies use the install wizard to set up your practice

.bold The (Relatively) Easy Way  (Still needs a little Linux Knowledge)

We hope in the near future that EasyGP will be available from the Software Sources of the major distributions. At the moment you will have to know enough about linux to add these lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list file from a terminal. Lets say your name is fred:

.item Edit your sources file e.g fred@laptop$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
.item Add these lines to your sources.list file

deb ftp://ozdocit.org/pub/easygp/ /

deb-src ftp://ozdocit.org/pub/easygp/ /

.item Update your system fred@laptop$ sudo apt-get update

If running EasyGP only on a local machine:

.item Install all packages locally fred@laptop$ sudo apt-get install easygp-server easygp-client easygp-doc pgadmin3


If running EasyGP with the database on a file server then you should install the easygp-server package on that file server and the remaining two packages on your local machine.

EasyGP will be installed and an icon will be in your menu, usually along with other Office applications.


When running EasyGP for the first time a setup wizard will appear.

.subsection Setup Wizard

If the database has been successfully built, the database named easygp and a default user called 'easygp' will have been created. 
If you inspect the database using pgAdmin, it should look something similar to this:

.image gettingstarted/pgadmin-users.png


The user 'easygp' has the permissions necessary to allow you use the Wizard which will appear when you first run EasyGP. You must of course logon to the database as user 'easygp', using the password you entered during the program installation. The wizard will allow you to add your general practice as a new organisation and to add the first user as your practice's system administrator.

Note the user 'easygp' is not and will never be a  'staff member' and as such cannot run the clinical sections of the program. 

After the Wizard has been run, you should logon as the sysadmin you created, and enter any further 
.xref staff members
 or 
.xref organisations
 that you wish, as well as configure many of the other sections of the program, prior to real clinical use.
