.item A Windows or Mac PC running a virtual machine running Linux
.item A widescreen monitor is preferred

EasyGP has been designed to take advantage of the screen width of a modern widescreen monitor and though it will run quite happily on your 15 inch laptop, the screen will be a little cramped.

.bold Which Linux Distribution?

In theory it should not matter, however debian based distrubutions seem to us to be easier to maintain and the many which are based in Ubuntu, have good long term support.

Many users coming from a Windows environment find Linux a little bit strange at first. Personally I'd stay away from Gnome based desktops in that case, whereas desktops based on KDE tend to be more windows like, though in recent years KDE itself has become a little unstable.

For the purists who want ony stability 'Debian' itself.

For the pragmatists like myself who like things a little more modern then we'd recommend Linux Mint, which is available in a number of desktop flavours. I find the 'Mate' desktop version clean, crisp and clear, it is highly customizable,  and users coming from Windows would probably feel most at home using this distribution. All of the screen dumps for this help file were taken from that desktop customised with the MCity-Graphite window borders.
