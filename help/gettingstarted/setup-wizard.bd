.subsubsection  Using the Wizard
During the package installation you will have been prompted to type in a password for the easygp user, lets say you used the password 'admin'. When you first run easyGP a logon dialog will appear. If you are running in a networked environment, you must put in the network address first as shown in the second dialog pictured here:

You will then be presented with the first page of the wizard which tells you a little EasyGP itself and its limitations.


After reading this there are a number of steps to complete, some of which will be described in more detail in this help:

.item About the Licence and Specific Disclaimers
.item Accept the licence agreement
.item Wizard installation options
.item Creating your practice organisation
.item Creating a system administrator
.item Reviewing your configuration
.item Save your configuration
.item Running EasyGP for the first time



.subsubsection  Licence Agreement

You should read the entire text of the licence properly and understand it as you are legally 
obliged to adhere to this licence once you have clicked the accept licence checkupbox and 
installed the software.


.subsubsection  Your Practice Details

.end imagetext


In this section you should enter the name of the head office or your organisation
usually this will be the general practice you work in.

The setup wizard will assist you by popping up lists of suburbs, and generally prompting 
you for missing information.

Should you later decided you have made a mistake and have not yet completed the setup
you may use the 'Previous' button to re-visit any of the pages. 

After completion of the setup wizard, this information can of course be changed
in the EasyGP Contacts Manager.

.bold A Special note about using categories.

Categories are used extensively in EasyGP to help you organise your information.Here we mean
the type of category you wish your organisation to belong to - usually a 'general practice'.


.subsubsection  The System Administrator

The system administrator should be a trusted member of your staff and should have 
a reasonable knowledge of Information Technology and using computer programs as they 
will be given access rights to all modules and database functions.


.subsubsection  Previewing your setup

You will be presented with a summary of the information you have entered.

This page is the last chance to either go back and change what you are not happy about, or 
to cancel the wizard.
 
Once you click the 'Next' button, the data from the wizard will be written to the database.



.subsubsection Completing the initial setup

At this point you may run EasyGP,  as the user you entered as sysadmin, here called 'DOC'.

This user as previously mentioned can add other uses and perform administrative and setup functions for your practice.
