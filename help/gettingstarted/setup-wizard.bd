.subsubsection  Using the Wizard
During the package installation you will have been prompted to type in a password for the easygp user, lets say you used the password 'admin'. When you first run easyGP a logon dialog will appear. If you are running in a networked environment, you must put in the network address first:

In this section you should enter the name of the head office or your organisation

The setup wizard will assist you by popping up lists of suburbs, and generally prompting 
you for missing information.

Should you later decided you have made a mistake and have not yet completed the setup
you may use the 'Previous' button to re-visit any of the pages. 

After completion of the setup wizard, this information can of course be changed
in the EasyGP Contacts Manager.

.bold A Special note about using categories.

Categories are used extensively in EasyGP to help you organise your information.Here we mean
the type of category you wish your organisation to belong to - usually a 'general practice'.


.subsubsection  The System Administrator

will be given access rights to all modules and database functions.

staff members, organisations such as hospitals, pathology providers etc,
