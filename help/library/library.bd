The library, accessed from 
.xref The side bar 
 of EasyGP

The central area of the library will be occupied by whatever type of document
you are viewing.

In the image above, an embedded web browser is showing the NSW Ciap site.

The library will read the file extension of whatever file you select and choose
the appropriate display tool, be it web-browser, pdf, text, or image viewer.

The libary is divided into four basic subsections which you may read about in the
following sections
.item My Libary
.item Handouts
.item Internet Resources
.item Favorites

.subsection My Library

The directory structure of your own library is up to you, but all files or subdirectories
containing the information that you want to be displayed under the
.xref My Library Tab
 should be under the main library directory.

You can copy any type of valid file here, eg html files, pdf files, text files or images. 
Selecting a file from the list under the My Library tab will display the file in the central
viewing area as shown below.

In the current release of EasyGP, the library directory is common to all users. In future 
releases it is planned to make this a user specific subdirectory with the ability to share
files between users if so desired.

The next section will discuss 
.xref Patient Handouts

.subsection Patient Handouts

The patient handout section is, as the name suggests, a respository of patient orientated
literature.

Like 
.xref My Library
 the files which will be viewed exist under a directory called handouts. The default directory
structure which is setup when you first install EasyGP is the same as My Library, however you 
my delete or add directories as you see fit.
