The purpose of this  document is to give an overview of the open-source medical records project EasyGP which has been 
written initially for the Australian medical general practice environment, though it is hoped it will equally be 
applicable in other similar environments in other specialties, and around the world. 

Written in Gambas Basic and using PostgreSQL as the database backend, its functionality is closely tied to 
Dr Richard Terry's original visual basic client, written way back in the dim distant past of last century in the mid-1990s. 

For several years after the year 2000,  Horst Herb (a General Practitioner + IT Guru),  Richard Terry (a Newcastle General Practitioner), 
and  Ian Haywood, (a Melbourne-based psychiatry registrar - now psychiatrist) were involved with the GNUMed project, however it became clear after a number of years that the project was progressing in a direction that would ultimately not be useful to Australian general practitioners, and was reluctantly abandoned.

In 2008, Richard frustrated by the continuing poor quality of medical software in Australia stumbled upon Gambas, and with his background in Basic programming, deciding to take the bull by the horns, took up programming after a break of some years, and crafted the outline of what has become EasyGP. Progress has been somewhat erratic and intermittent due to Richard's work committment's and Ian's study, but after quite long breaks in development 2012-13 has seen the project maturing to its current state, ready for beta-testing. 

Special thanks to Horst for funding programming of some of the more complex sections (HL7 messaging) and to Bernd Brinkmann for that work, and to Tim Messiter (graphic artist) for our Logo and other artwork, to Heidrun for linking so many of the Pharmacy Guild PDF's to the pbs drugs, and to the never ending patience of my staff who have suffered through the daily crashes in their day-to-day work. Finally without the work of Benoit Minisini and co-workers Gambas itself would never have become a reality.
