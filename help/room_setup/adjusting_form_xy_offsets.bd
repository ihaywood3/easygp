.subsection Fine Tuning Form Printing


      Sometimes the co-ordinates built into EasyGP for printing forms may not be exactly the same as needed by your printer.
      
     The x-y co-ordinates where the text starts can be adjusted in millimeter increments (or 0.5mm) by 
     changing the vertical and horizontal offset values listed next to the apppropriate forms listed. This way you can more the output up, down 
     left or right, so that what gets printed on your page lines up better with the underlying pre-printed forms or the supplied electronic pdf 
     version of your forms.
     
     At the moment, only the centrerlink medical form is listed.
