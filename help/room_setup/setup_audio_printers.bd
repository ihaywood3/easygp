.subsection Setting Defaults for Printers and Audio

In this section you may tell EasyGP which printers are to be used for which particular task, and which audio device you would like to use for dictation etc.  Please test your printers to ensure they are working satisfactorily. Any choices you make will be automatically saved as they are selected.

Note that these default will be 
.italic computer specific
  i.e will apply to which ever printers are available on the machine you are running EasyGP. Should you move this machine to another room and re-attach different printers you will have to do the  setup again.

.bold  Default Printer

This should be the printer in your room you wish to use to print plain paper documents, or the printer into which you may put a pre-printed form that EasyGP has the ability to print output to, for example the centrelink medical certificate.


.bold Script Printer

This will be the printer to which you send your prescriptions. Note that as pre-formatted prescription paper is required in Australia that this will usually be a dedicated printer.


.bold Request Printer

Note that requests in EasyGP for example for pathology or radiology testing are printed on plain paper, so you should ensure you select a plain paper printer - usually the Default printer on your system.

.bold Default Audio Device

This will be used during any dication see
