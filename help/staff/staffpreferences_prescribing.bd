.subsubsection Staff Preferences - Prescribing


.paragraph Default Prescribing Mode

You may tell EasyGP here if you wish to prescribe primarily by brand name, or primary by generic name. 

Though open to debate, it is now generally recognised that is is safer to prescribe by the generic name of the drug. 
In practice this  may or may not be difficult, especially when the generic names are long and complicated.

In practice the output of the script will be virtually identical as you can see below.

.paragraph Prescribe by Brand

If the brand option button is set as the default, when you choose to prescribe a new drug in the prescriptions section the
 cursor will be set to the brand line, and the popup lists of drugs as you type will be brands.
 
 .bold Prescribe by Generic

.image staff/prescribe_by_generic.png

If the generic option button is set as the default, when you choose to prescribe a new drug in the prescriptions section the
 cursor will be set to the genericlLine, and the popup lists of drugs as you type will be generics, however as soon as you
 select a generic, you will be shown a list of the corresponding available brands. If you hit the <enter> key on this line 
 a random generic will be shown as the brand, however should you wish to prescribe a specific brand, you can arrow across to
 the brands list, and select from there.
 
 .bold Output on the script paper
 
 Irregardless of which method you choose the output will be pretty much the same, i.e:
 
 salbutamol sulfate
 [brand]           < name here if prescribing by brand otherwise this line does not print on the script
 2 puffs qid via volumatic
 for Asthma
