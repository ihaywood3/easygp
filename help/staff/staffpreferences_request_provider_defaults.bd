.subsubsection Staff Preferences Ordering

In this section the individual staff member may tell EasyGP which provider they would like as the default to send a request referral to as the default for each category of request.

For example, if you live in a particular suburb and send patients to pathology, it is obviously useful to have the request automatically select a branch near your office.

Please note that currently only companies, not individuals are supported, and any companies you wish to access here both must exist in the contacts database and your system administrator must have told EasyGP that the particular company provides a particular type of request see
