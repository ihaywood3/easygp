.subsubsection Staff Preferences Ordering

In this section the individual staff member may tell EasyGP which provider they would like as the default to send a request referral to as the default for each category of request.

For example, if you live in a particular suburb and send patients to pathology, it is obviously useful to have the request automatically select a branch near your office.
