.subsection User Preferences Ordering 

When you are ordering a request in the clinical section e.g a radiology or pathology request, you have the option of sending the patient to any provider of that type. However, you may have preferences - a particular company at a particular location, and this section allows you to set your preferences for that.

Prior to individual users being able to set their preferred company they wish to send a particular type of request to, the several things need to have been done:

.item
In Admin.Setup Ordering.Setup Entities To Receive Requests the Admin user must tell EasyGP that a company will recieve particuliar types of requests. When the Admin user does this all users will be allocated Admin's choice of preferred provider.
