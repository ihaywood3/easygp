.subsection Delivered Messages

All HL7 or PIT information delivered, be the content X-ray, pathology, incoming specialist letters or hospital dischange summaries, will end up being shown in the 
.bold Delivered list.
Here, the highlighted delivery is a result for EBV, which probably was ordered in the surgery as Epstein-Barr virus EIA IgG IGM.

Things will not always be this obvious however, as the names of delivered results can either be ambiguous, or may mean multiple things.

For example your pathology provider may deliver a result as 'biochemistry' which could have been requested by you as say 
BSL, HDL, UEC, Calcium, Magnesium etc etc. A result called 'Hormones' delivered from your provider could have been requested as testosterone or 
LH at your end. Even weirder a test delivered as as `E498' could have orginated in your hands as 'carcinoembryonic antigen', or 
`X01' a term used in the lab may have started life at your desk as eGFR!

A quick peek inside a database table will quickly illustrate the problem:

In the next section we will look at how we match what is delivered, to what you want to see on the screen when you are later using the patients clinical notes.
