I have paid for or am liable to pay the expenses for these services and these services are not excluded under the \emph{Health Insurance Act 1973} (i.e. are not for the purpose of life insurance, superannuation or provident account schemes, admission to a friendly society, health screening, mass immunisation or connected with employment) and/or \emph{Dental Benefits Act 2008}. To the best of my knowledge and belief all the information disclosed in the lodging of this claim is true and accurate. I authorise the medical practice to electronically transmit my claim for Medicare benefits to the Department of Human Services on my behalf. I also authorise the Department of Human Services to contact the referring provider or the provider of the services if clarification of details on the account and/or receipt is required for assessment or auditing purposes. 
For this claim, I have consented to this practice sending to, and receiving from the Department of Human Services, the following information for verification:
