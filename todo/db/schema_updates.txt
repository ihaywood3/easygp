From now on, in order to safely use easygp in real world situations,
the database structure needs to be updated / modified in a safe, non-destructive way.

Required steps:
1) database version in a table, starting with 1 now.
2) all modifications from now on are done via SQL scripts (create table, update ...)
stored in svn under db/updates/easygp.[version number].sql
