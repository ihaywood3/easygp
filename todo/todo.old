eg. insert an oocupation > add a susbtance, delete the exposure > crash.
compare occupations_selection in occupations and person and organisations "accept"
provider defaults problem:
- to figure (refigure) the whole implementation of Provider Categories. A thought - perhaps if user adds a new category, then first add
to clin_requests.lu_types but add extra field (the fk of lu_categoreis in contacts which will contain the new cateogry (eg massage provider), 
then look at integegrating this in the requests table.



consider changing the rquest form to include all the comms in the middle.
Fix lateralisation in requests section.


put in new item saved > changed > audit trail not modified to reflect that this change occurred during same consult
viewed the audit and it wasn't removed on new patient.
  
mental health plan missing a pk_audit in the audit tables.
Put in request for echo, saved under general. 
Decided should put chest pain is as new problem then re-linked (edited) the request.

Request still ended up in general notes, not transfered to the problem.

progress notes editor
- smarter parsing for bp, because if do bp<space>= <space dosn't pick it up.
Bugger but: check all columnviews in entire program and make sure multi-select = single
deleting a recall - fix the whole audi screen debacle
deleting a recall the progress note page was open and not updated
put little help buttons in all sections.
no mention in the pogress notes that  a recall was deleted
clumbsy about general staff members

check what happens to progress note if deleted
anywhere needing coding through program - set default checkbox on icd10
figure out how to update flag if k10 is changed

when first do a plan, dosn't appear as the last plan

Big bad bug ?solution
if have a field like person!salutation  = "Fred", and  you delete "Fred" to ""
this effectively sets the field to null

Definate contacts bug - add new company, first employee > not saved
link names to sex


Bug: deleting an unsaved team care member - check this in past history as well.
Preferences bugs
click on row in cview, first one dosn't change the editing data changed, second row it does
Can't save new providers after the first ones
